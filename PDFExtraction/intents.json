                "A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.The Company\u2019s products, services, and solutions include proprietary software, physical intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) for integrated circuit (\u201cIC\u201d) designs, electrical measurement hardware tools, proven methodologies, and professional services.Actual results could differ from those estimates and may result in material effects on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial position.As of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance relating to COVID-19 that would require updates to the Company\u2019s estimates and judgments or revisions to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities.Restricted cash of $3.5 million noted in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 pertains to the amount specifically designated to pay for the Holdback amount related to the Company\u2019s acquisition of Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d).An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon the Company\u2019s assessment of the expected collectability of the accounts receivable.In addition, the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate.In determining the present value of the Company\u2019s expected lease payments, the discount rate is calculated using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate determined based on the information available, which requires additional judgment.The Company\u2019s capitalized software development costs consist of internal compensation related costs and external direct costs incurred during the application development stage and are amortized over their useful lives, generally five to six years.Software license costs consist of costs associated with cloud-delivery related expenses and licensing third-party software used by us in providing services to the Company\u2019s customers in solution engagements or sold in conjunction with the Company\u2019s software products.The fair value of the Company\u2019s restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) is equal to the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of the grant.60 Income Taxes The Company\u2019s provision for income tax comprises its current tax liability and change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.The Company\u2019s income tax calculations are based on application of applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign tax laws.The Company\u2019s tax filings, however, are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities.Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, upon vesting of RSUs, contingently issuable shares for all periods and assumed issuance of shares under the Company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan.Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the Company\u2019s amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including in-process research and development, and goodwill, are not amortized but tested annually for impairment."

                "Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions.As of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance relating to COVID-19 that would require updates to the Company\u2019s estimates and judgments or revisions to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities.The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with what it considers high credit quality financial institutions.The Company primarily sells its products and services to companies in Asia, Europe and North America within the semiconductor industry.The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses.57 Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less or investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the purchase to be cash equivalents and investments with original maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year to be short-term investments.The Company classifies securities with readily determinable market values as available-for-sale.The Company periodically reviews short-term investments for impairment.When determining if a decline in value is other- than-temporary, the Company takes into consideration the current market conditions, the duration and severity of and the reason for the decline, and the likelihood that it would need to sell the security prior to a recovery of par value.The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, may not be recoverable.When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets.The Company has one operating segment and one operating unit.The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or more frequently, if required to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill.Leases The Company has operating leases for administrative and sales offices, research and development laboratory and clean room.The Company recognizes long-term operating lease rights and commitments as operating lease right-of-use assets (ROU), operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, non-current, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases.The Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception.Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method, which requires the Company to measure stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period.Accordingly, the Company recognizes tax liabilities based upon its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely-than-not to be sustained.No dilutive potential common shares are included in the computation of any diluted per share amount when a loss from continuing operations was reported by the Company.Derivative Financial Instruments The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.Business Combinations The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the business combination.Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.The Company accrues for losses related to litigation when a potential loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requirements.The Company will adopt this standard effective the first quarter of 2023.The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 326 on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosure but does not believe it will have a material effect."
