            "Business Overview": "We provide comprehensive data solutions designed to empower organizations across the semiconductor ecosystem to improve the yield and quality of their products and operational efficiency for increased profitability. We derive revenues from two sources, Analytics and Integrated Yield Ramp. Our offerings contribute to Analytics revenue through contract fees for on-premise software and hardware system licenses, software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d), and other professional services. Certain of our Characterization services engagements contribute to Integrated Yield Ramp revenue through contract fees and a value-based, variable fee or royalty, which we call Gainshare. We are headquartered in Santa Clara, California and also operate worldwide with offices in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Our customers include Fortune 500 companies across the semiconductor ecosystem. These companies use our products and services to achieve various goals depending on whether they are integrated device manufacturers (\u201cIDMs\u201d), fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, equipment manufacturers, electronics manufacturing suppliers (\u201cEMS\u201d), original device manufacturers (\u201cODMs\u201d), out-sourced semiconductor assembly and test (\u201cOSATs\u201d), or system houses. For example, our foundry customers generate and analyze key manufacturing data using our solutions to shorten the time necessary for technology development and to provide their fabless customers with a higher yielding process with improved electrical performance, which are both critical metrics for market success. Higher yields in less time can also mean less total raw materials and process runs, which help lower customers\u2019 total cost and minimize environmental impact. Also, equipment manufacturers and factories use our connectivity products to implement evolving industry standards for their equipment or operations, respectively, with required quality and stability. By way of further example, our IDM and fabless customers use our solutions to generate unique, differentiated data that can be analyzed with our machine learning (\u201cML\u201d) and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) algorithms to predict downstream manufacturing issues, resulting in shorter time for designs to meet performance requirements with fewer iterations and faster time-to-market. For final example, our foundry and OSAT customers use the AI and ML applications of our software to optimize for process control, assembly, and/or test. Our mission is to provide innovative solutions to create, access, and organize data to enable analysis and control for semiconductor and electronics companies to achieve better time-to-market, yields, quality, and operational efficiencies. Our strategy to achieve this is as follows: \u2022  Offer a Common, Flexible Platform for a Broad Group of Customers Across the Supply Chain . As semiconductor and electronics products are made with the efforts of equipment manufacturers, front-end foundries, chip and system designers, design automation, intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) providers, and OSATs, there is a need to analyze the data across this whole chain to optimize yields, operational efficiencies, time to market, quality, and reliability. The Exensio platform is designed to provide a common platform - whether deployed in the cloud or on premise - to enable these different participants to analyze the relevant end-to-end data in near real-time, with data stores from 10s to 100s of terabytes (TBs) and flexible configurations for IDM, foundry, fabless, and OSAT specific needs. Our ML solutions combine professional services with the Exensio platform to further enable our customers to push their analytics \u201cto the edge\u201d of their global supply chains and shift the analysis and decision-making processes closer to where their data is being generated. We believe enabling edge analytics will further increase our customers\u2019 ability to improve product yield, quality, performance, and profitability, and therefore, should drive the market for our products and services. \u2022  Drive Tool-Level Software Installations to Create an Infrastructure of Connected Equipment and Enable Smart Factories . We believe that driving installation of our software products at the tool level will provide an infrastructure of connected equipment and help to enable smart factories. In July 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Advantest Corporation through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Advantest America, Inc., (collectively, \u201cAdvantest\u201d), and have since released Exensio analytics applications that run on Advantest test and computer hardware. In April 2022, we announced an additional collaboration with a leading back-end test and assembly provider. We believe these relationships will allow us to increase the network of tools connected with 5 PDF software and provide Advantest and other tool customers with increased data management and analytics. In December 2020, we acquired Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d) and began providing software products based on open standards for equipment control and connectivity to equipment manufacturers and factories. We believe that in the smart manufacturing era, the industry will demand the increased equipment connectivity and control our products and solutions offer. Further, we believe that the benefits from integration between analytics on equipment, the factory, and in the cloud will provide synergies with our existing end-to-end analytics offerings. \u2022  Create Differentiated Data Sources for Better Analytics . Historically, companies have only used data that was generated from their manufacturing and test process to drive improvements. We offer unique IP (such as Characterization Vehicle\u00ae test chips, also branded CV\u00ae test chips) that is not part of an IC\u2019s functionality, but significantly improves the manufacturing process by improving yield learning and reducing time to market. Also, our Design-for-Inspection\u2122 system (also branded DFI\u2122 system) identifies blockers that impact product yield and quality months earlier than any other hardware- or software-based methodology from proprietary e-beam measurement of product layout or provided on-chip instrumentation. We believe that in the More-than-Moore (\u201cMtM\u201d) era, the differentiated data we provide can play an important role in enabling our customers to bring new products to market faster and with higher quality and performance, and, ultimately, more profitability. \u2022  Collaborate with Other Industry Leaders to Bring Additional Unique Data to Our Platform and Enable New and Differentiated Applications . We believe that the value we bring to semiconductor manufacturing can be leveraged with additional data and through differentiated applications. For example, in December 2021, we announced a collaboration with Siemens to connect integrated circuit test and yield data with manufacturing and test data collected and managed by our Exensio\u00ae analytics platform, to enable customers to rapidly analyze and identify yield correlations that are otherwise undetectable quickly, and in some cases automatically. In July 2022, we announced a collaboration with SAP to connect factory data, including data collected and managed by our Exensio\u00ae analytics platform, to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) data in SAP S/4HANA\u00ae to enable greater efficiencies in semiconductor manufacturing. Relationships such as these are intended to provide more ways for mutual customers to leverage their process and product data as part of their Industry 4.0 initiatives. Differentiated applications that make use of this shared data are designed to provide unique insights to help customers achieve sustained profitability in their manufacturing. "

            "Brief History": "PDF Solutions was incorporated in Pennsylvania in November 1992, and we reincorporated in California in November 1995. In July 2000, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in July 2001, we completed an initial public offering. Our shares of common stock are currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cPDFS\u201d. From 2000 through 2009, we expanded our technology footprint and our operations in various countries through acquisitions. From 2009 to 2019, we primarily focused on the pervasive application of our technology to leading edge logic manufacturing and achieving yield targets with our clients that maximized Gainshare royalties. In 2013, we leveraged our extensive experience in yield simulation software and CV\u00ae test chip development and started research and development on an e-beam solution for non-contact, inline electrical inspection and process control for wafer inspection. The first-generation e-beam tool for DFI\u2122 was completed in 2015, and the second generation was commercially deployed in 2019. In a parallel effort, starting in 2014, we re-architected our point-solution software tools into a new generation, highly-integrated data analytics Exensio platform, which resulted in accelerated growth in our software business through 2019. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Cimetrix and began providing software products based on open standards for equipment control and connectivity to equipment manufacturers and factories.

            "Industry Background": "Rapid technological innovation with increasingly shorter product life cycles has fueled the economic growth of the semiconductor industry since the days of the PC revolution. IC companies have historically ramped production slowly, produced at high volume once a product gained market acceptance, and slowly reduced production volume when price and demand started to decrease near the end of the product\u2019s life cycle. Today there are many different business models across the semiconductor industry: products that follow the traditional life cycle just described, products targeted towards 6 fast-moving market segments like Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) \u2013 which utilize mature process nodes and requires a fast ramp to volume with a relatively short life cycle, and products focused on long term market segments like automotive and industrial where product life cycles can last a decade or longer. There is a lot of variation across these business models depending on the level of design complexity and the maturity of the process node used for product implementation. Processors, memory and field-programmable gate arrays (\u201cFPGA\u201d) continue to leverage the most advanced process nodes and experience significant challenges to achieve competitive initial yields and optimized performance. Some products and market segments, however, are content to utilize older process nodes. Regardless of the process node used for implementation or how long the product will be sold in the market, success for every semiconductor company is predicated, among other things, on fast product yield ramp and the ability to optimize manufacturing and test metrics, such as yield reclamation, product quality, and test efficiency, throughout a product\u2019s life cycle. Thus, technologies or capabilities that can accelerate yield ramp, improve product quality, and optimize production efficiencies are highly sought after because they typically lead to cost reduction and revenue generation concurrently, causing a leveraged effect on profitability.

            "Technology and Intellectual Property Protection": "Our success is largely dependent upon our proprietary software. We believe the creative skills and technological ability of our personnel, product enhancements, and new product development are necessary to maintaining our position as a leading provider. We rely primarily on trade secret rights, copyright and trademark laws, and nondisclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our technology. We seek to protect our IP under patent laws and as of December 31, 2022, we held 185 U.S. patents. Our issued patents have expiration dates from 2023 through 2041. We intend to prepare additional patent applications when we feel it is beneficial. We also employ protection of our trademarks, with registration of marks, including Characterization Vehicle, Cimetrix, CV, eProbe, Exensio, pdFasTest, PDF Solutions, and the PDF Solutions and Cimetrix logos. We have common law rights to additional trademarks, including ALPS, DFI, DirectProbe, DirectScan, FIRE, and VarScan. We also enter into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and confidentiality and license agreements with our customers and the various parties we partner with to resell, distribute, and, in some cases, integrate our products. Further, we limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Third parties could in any case develop competing technologies that include similar functionality or features, or otherwise are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries where we operate. Our business could suffer significantly if we fail to protect our proprietary technology. In addition, through yield, performance, and reliability improvement services over more than 20 years, we have accumulated a vast library of physical IP in the form of test structures. As part of our DFI and CV systems, our engineers create designs of experiments (\u201cDOEs\u201d) and layouts for targeted fail modes. We have also developed electrical measurement hardware tools and proprietary extraction, design, and analysis software. In addition, our technology embodies many production-proven and patented algorithms. Further, our IP includes proven methodologies that our implementation teams use as guidelines to drive our customers\u2019 use of our technology. We strive to continually enhance our core technologies through the codification of knowledge that we gain in the use of our products and delivery of services. "

            "Products and Services": "Products Our primary software products and software and hardware systems include the following: Exensio Platform . Our separately-offered Exensio software products address the big data manufacturing challenge of today\u2019s advanced process nodes and highly integrated products, by providing a common environment throughout the supply chain for different data types, including inline and end-of-line metrology, yield, parametric, performance, manufacturing consumables, tool-level sensor data, test floor data, logistical data, as well as custom data types. Exensio products are designed to enable real-time rapid diagnosis and understanding of key manufacturing and test metrics during both inline and end-of-line wafer processing, helping customers reduce product variability and cost simultaneously. By integrating silos of data and applying AI and ML, Exensio products resolve the limitation of local optimization and provide better foresight across the entire production process, reducing the time it takes to make critical decisions that can drive 7 higher product yield, quality and reliability. Our collaboration with strategic partners is intended to also integrate data from those partners\u2019 products to make it available in Exensio and also to develop new applications to inter-operate with those products and enhance the value to mutual customers. Exensio products are available as either an on-premise license or SaaS and are offered in four main, separately-offered Exensio products targeting the needs of the customer\u2019s business model: Exensio IDM, Exensio Fabless, Exensio Foundry, and Exensio OSAT. Each of these products are comprised of two or more modules to provide specific capabilities to address a particular type of company\u2019s needs and requirements; however, there are common features, functionality, and purpose across some of the key modules as follows: \u2022 Manufacturing Analytics \u2013 This module uses our proprietary database schema to store collected data in a common environment with a consistent view. For example, product engineers use it to identify and analyze production yield, performance, reliability and other issues. Elements of this module are designed to handle very large and complex data sets that are commonplace in the semiconductor industry. To support the multi-dimensional product requirements of our customers, the powerful, interactive visualization and analysis capabilities in this product are highly flexible and user-configurable. \u2022 Process Control \u2013 This module provides failure detection and classification (\u201cFDC\u201d) capabilities for monitoring, alarming, and control of manufacturing tool sets.

Test Operations is also designed to provide predictive insights based on proprietary analytics during test, assembly and packaging to maximize the efficiency of test operations, productivity improvements and yield reclamation. \u2022 Assembly Operations \u2013 This module provides the capability to link assembly and packaging data with other product lifecycle data, including fabrication and characterization data, across the product life cycle. Data sources could include manufacturing, wafer acceptance test, wafer sort, test and assembly, final test, and field use. The proprietary data linkage enabled by Assembly Operations is also designed to enable device manufacturers to maintain full traceability of their finished products back to the source wafer without the need for Electronic Chip IDs (\u201cECIDs\u201d). This capability is becoming an essential requirement for safety-critical market segments such as automotive and military-aerospace. Design-for-Inspection System. Our DFI\u2122 System leverages our production-proven design and analysis infrastructure and is designed to enable customers to achieve non-contact, inline electrical inspection of either our proprietary on-chip instruments or their product chip layout structures. The electrical measurements augment and enhance existing inline defect inspection and metrology methods for more effective process control and inline, direct inspection of product wafers. The DirectScan application of the DFI system includes our proprietary Exensio Characterization and Fire\u2122 layout analysis software and the eProbe\u00ae non-contact e-beam tool. The original application of the DFI system also included our on-chip instruments. These elements are described as follows: \u2022 Fire\u2122 Feature Analysis Software \u2013 This proprietary software, which may also be part of our Exensio platform, is designed to analyze layout features. In particular, this software helps to determine which parts of the product layout to inspect. \u2022 DFI On-Chip Instruments \u2013 Our on-chip measurement instruments are tuned to capture key features of our customers\u2019 product layouts. As part of the system offering, we generally provide design services to create these 8 instruments. These DFI instruments are designed to be placed in test chips, scribe lines, or in product die, without any area penalty, and to exhibit specific electrical responses. \u2022 eProbe\u00ae Non-Contact E-Beam Tool \u2013 Our eProbe e-beam tools are designed for contactless measurement of the electrical response of the DFI instruments and suitable product layout structures. As part of the system offering, we generally provide tool support services to customers to operate this tool. The third generation tool includes advances in accuracy and sensitivity and, in addition to enabling DFI on-chip instruments to be used for inline control for leading-edge semiconductor process nodes, is designed to enable customers to see defects in product wafers inline within acceptable queue time and much higher throughput. \u2022 Exensio Characterization Software \u2013 This software, which is also a part of our Exensio platform, is designed to analyze the billions of measurements collected using the eProbe tool. As part of the system offering, we generally provide to our customers analysis services, a summary of our findings and recommendations. Characterization Vehicle (\u201cCV\u201d) System. Our CV system is a combination of CV test chips, hardware to test such products, software to analyze the test results, and related services. This system is designed to accelerate the efficiency of yield learning by shortening the learning cycle, learning more per cycle, and reducing the number of silicon wafers required in manufacturing processes. This system includes physical IP in the form of test structures and DOEs that are tuned to our customers\u2019 product and/or process specifics, tester hardware, data analysis, and training. The primary software and hardware products included in the CV system are as follows: \u2022 CV Test Chips \u2013 Our proprietary test chips are designed by our professional engineers using our proprietary FIRE\u2122 layout analysis software. These test chips are run through a customer\u2019s manufacturing process, with intentional process modifications, to provide unique, differentiated data to explore the effects of potential process improvements given natural manufacturing variations. Our custom-designed CV test chips are optimized for our test hardware and analysis software and include DOEs tuned to each customer\u2019s process. Types of CV test chips include: \u2022 Our full-reticle and shared-reticle CV test chips are designed to provide a fast-learning cycle and are fully integrated with third-party failure analysis and inspection tools for a complete diagnosis to understand root causes. Our full-reticle CV test chips use a shortened process flow to provide a faster learning cycle for specific process modules. \u2022 Our Scribe CV test chip are inserted directly on customers\u2019 product wafers to collect data about critical layers. \u2022 Our DirectProbe\u2122 CV test chips are designed to enable ultra-fast yield learning for new product designs by allowing our clients to measure components of actual product layout. \u2022 Our VarScan\u2122 CV test chips are designed for front-end or through-silicon via (\u201cTSV\u201d) application with a focus on high resolution resistance variation analysis for mass production. \u2022 pdFasTest \u00ae Electrical Tester \u2013 Our proprietary test hardware is optimized to quickly test our CV test chips, enabling fast defect and parametric characterization of manufacturing processes. As part of the system offering, we provide test programs for each CV test chip that are tuned to the customer\u2019s process. This automated system provides parallel functional testing, thus minimizing the time required to perform millions of electrical measurements to test our CV test chips. We provide services to analyze the unique, differentiated data output of this tester using the Exensio Characterization software to provide actionable insights to our customers. \u2022 Exensio Characterization software \u2013 This software, which is also a part of our Exensio platform, collects the data generated from our CV test products, generating models of the performance effects of process variations on these design building blocks. As part of the system offering, we also offer analysis services, if the customer elects not to do such analysis itself. 9 Cimetrix\u00ae Software Products . Our Cimetrix software products enable equipment manufacturers to provide industry standard interfaces on their products for efficient equipment communication, control, and collection of equipment data. There are numerous industry standards that have been established for equipment connectivity and control, including the SEMI defined SECS (SEMI Equipment Communication Standard), GEM (Generic Equipment Model), and PV2 (new photovoltaic equipment communication standard based on SECS/GEM) standards. By providing software products that fully support these industry standards, equipment manufacturers can implement robust, turnkey support for these connectivity and control standards without needing to invest engineering resources to develop their own interfaces to these standards. Factories that purchase manufacturing equipment enabled with Cimetrix-supported interfaces, benefit from consistent and robust implementations of industry standards, enabling faster and more efficient implementation of smart manufacturing initiatives that depend on the collection and analysis of manufacturing and product data. There are two separate Cimetrix product lines targeting the needs of factory equipment connectivity and control. The products are sold via perpetual licenses and runtime royalties. \u2022 Equipment Factory Connectivity \u2013 Our products for equipment factory connectivity primarily include the following: \u2022 CIMConnect \u2122 is designed for general purpose equipment connectivity and enables production equipment in the semiconductor and electronics industries to communicate data to the factory\u2019s host computer through the SECS/GEM and PV2 standards. CIMConnect can also support other emerging communications standards for maximum flexibility. In addition, it supports multiple-host interfaces simultaneously, which allows customers to support legacy, custom, and GEM interfaces. CIMConnect is used in semiconductor wafer fabrication, semiconductor back-end (test, assembly, and packaging), PV, HB-LED, disk drive, flat panel displays, printed circuit boards and other electronics manufacturing. \u2022 CIM300 \u2122 is a software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) used by manufacturers of 300mm semiconductor equipment that is designed to enable quick implementation of the required 300mm SEMI standards, including E39, E40, E87, E90, E94, E116, E148, and E157. These SEMI standards allow for the full automation required in manufacturing 300mm wafers. \u2022 CIMPortal \u2122 Plus is an SDK for equipment manufacturers that allows for quick implementation of the Interface A, also known as EDA (Equipment Data Acquisition), which includes SEMI standards E120, E125, E132, E134, E138, E147, and E164. Interface A specifies a new port on equipment that provides detailed structured data that can be used for advanced process control, e-diagnostics, and other equipment engineering service applications. These software applications are becoming critical to the fabs as shorter ramp times are required. \u2022 Equipment Control \u2013 Our equipment control product is the CIMControlFramework \u2122 (\u201cCCF\u201d) software, which is based on Microsoft.NET technology. It is designed to enable equipment manufacturers to meet the supervisory control, material handling, platform and process control, and factory automation requirements of the fabrication facilities or fabs. Developers can leverage framework components through configuration and extension or customize when unique requirements exist. CCF, unlike one-off solutions, is supported and maintained with upgrades, improvements, and performance enhancements. With a data-driven architecture at the core of the framework, data generated at any point on the equipment is designed to be quickly and easily accessed by any other module or external application. Services Our services are almost always sold together with, or to support, our products and include the following: Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) . We provide services to make our Exensio software available to our customers via the Internet, generally hosted by third-party providers. SaaS is considered part of cloud computing since the software is hosted on the Internet, or the \u201ccloud.\u201d Since our SaaS applications are accessed from a remote server rather than installed on individual machines, it is easier to maintain. For example, when the remote software is updated, the customer\u2019s interface is also updated for all users. Cloud computing is designed to eliminate incompatibilities between different software 10 versions and allow us to make incremental updates without requiring software downloads. Additionally, our customers can save data to a central online location, which is designed to allow increased project collaboration. As part of these services, we also typically provide hosted management services for the licensed software and the customer\u2019s data stored in our cloud. These services include environment set-up and configuration, system health monitoring, data integration maintenance, integration monitoring, system updates, security, and data upload/download, and license administration. Software Related Services . We provide software maintenance and support (\u201cM&S\u201d), data management services, various value-added services (\u201cVAS\u201d) to install, configure, or create analysis templates, and other professional services to achieve customers\u2019 specific outcomes using our software. We call this last type of services our solutions offering and, in these cases, we tailor the use of one or more Exensio products to achieve a desired result. For example, our AIM YieldAware\u2122 FDC solution offering is designed to identify the process control variables that have the greatest impact on product yield through professional services that analyze the data from both Exensio Process Control and elements of Exensio Manufacturing Analytics and make recommendations for the customer to implement. VAS are provided by our professional service personnel with expertise that enhances and complements the engineering teams at our customers. For example, VAS includes our data cleaning and monitoring services. One requirement of big data analytics is to have clean, harmonized data to analyze. This service offering outsources the data wrangling and management effort to free the customer to focus their efforts on analysis, which has a greater ROI to the company than data management. Characterization Services . These services are designed to characterize key product and/or process elements, primarily into CV test structures or DFI on-chip measurement instruments, and typically do not include performance incentives based on the customers\u2019 yield achievement. We provide these services, typically together with all elements of our CV system, to foundry customers in connection with new process technology development and/or yield ramp. In Characterization engagements, we generally provide the analysis of our CV test chips and provide summary findings and recommendations to the customer. Characterization engagements can include DFI systems. "

            "Competition": "The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing prices. We expect market competition to continue to develop and increase as the market for data and analytics continues to evolve. We believe IC companies benefit from a combination of big data management infrastructure, AI/ML-based analytics engines, and products that generate and collect differentiated data that enrich the analytics process. Currently, we are a leading provider of comprehensive commercial hardware, software and IP solutions for optimizing and improving design, manufacturing and test operations processes through the application of differentiated data and advanced analytics. We face indirect competition from internal groups at IC companies that offer tools with varying degrees of optimization to accelerate process-design integration or test operations. Some providers of semiconductor manufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their product offerings and compete with us. In addition, companies providing general ML and analytics software may focus on semiconductor companies and compete with us. In each of the market segments we compete in, we face competition from established and potential competitors, some of whom may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We currently face indirect competition from the internal groups at IC companies and direct competition from providers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA Corporation (\u201cKLA\u201d), Siemens AG (\u201cSiemens\u201d), Onto Innovation, Inc. (\u201cOnto\u201d), and Synopsys, Inc. (\u201cSynopsys\u201d); (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Inc (\u201cApplied Materials\u201d), Synopsys, Invantest, Inc., NI, Inc., Onto, and Siemens; (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as ASML Holding N.V. (\u201cASML\u201d), Applied Materials, KLA,  and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity software or integration products/services supporting factory equipment connectivity or control needs of customers, such as PEER Group, Inc., Kontron AIS, GmbH, Yokogawa Electric Corp., Advantest, and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There may be other providers of competitive commercial solutions of which we are not aware, and we may compete with the products or offerings of these named companies or additional companies if we expand our offerings through acquisition or development. For example, through our acquisition of Cimetrix in late 2020, we now face competition in the connectivity and integration products/services supporting factory equipment 12 connectivity or control. The demand for solutions that address the need for better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competitors to enter into our market. For example, in 2020, two of our competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys acquired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, and each has increased marketing or pricing competition with us. This competition in our market may intensify in the future, which could lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting our revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose to develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet market needs. These and other competitors may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than our engineering organization, which would give any such competitor\u2019s products a competitive advantage over our solutions. We believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to competition because we have demonstrated results and reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innovative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new technology and product generations. See the discussions in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A for more information about risks associated with our competition. "

            "Information Security and Risk Oversight": "We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to provide our products and services to our customers. As a result, we have developed an information security program (our \u201cInfoSec Program\u201d) to enhance our network security measures, identify and mitigate information security risk, and protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of critical information owned by us and that of our customers and suppliers that is in our care. Our InfoSec Program includes development, implementation, and continual improvement of policies and procedures to safeguard information and ensure availability of critical data and systems. The program also includes annual information security awareness training for employees involved in our systems and processes that handle customer data and audits of our systems and enhanced training for specialized personnel and we have instituted regular phishing email simulations for all employees and all contractors with access to corporate email systems to enhance awareness and responsiveness to such possible threats. Our InfoSec Program further includes review and assessment by external, independent third-parties, who certify and report on our weaknesses and internal response preparedness with respect to the entire company. Accordingly, we have instituted periodic network access penetration (\u201cPEN\u201d) testing no less than once per year both for our corporate network resources and our SaaS cloud-based offerings. In May 2022, we successfully completed our annual Type II System and Organization Control (\u201cSOC 2\u201d) audit of our cloud-based offerings under the framework put forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d) in which independent, third-party auditors assess and test controls relating to the Trust Services Criteria (\u201cTSC\u201d) of Security, Availability, and Confidentiality and no qualified findings were found during the audit period. In January 2023, we started our next annual Type II SOC 2 audit with external auditors and continued the audit process leading to ISO 27001 certification. To date, we have not managed ITAR-designated data, technology, or information. In accordance with our InfoSec Program, we also actively monitor known threats that could affect our products and services and work with our suppliers to provide us with real-time reports of threats or vulnerabilities that may affect our enterprise-wide systems. Our InfoSec Program also includes a data security incident response plan that provides controls and procedures for timely and accurate reporting of any material cybersecurity incident. As described in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is tasked with oversight of certain risk issues, including cybersecurity. The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors, two of whom have significant work experience related to information security issues or oversight. Management reports security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and provides a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee as well as the full Board about periodic assessment of our InfoSec Program, our internal response preparedness, and assessments led by outside advisors. We carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial and included no penalties or settlements. "

            "Environmental, Social & Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Matters": "We have recently taken key strategic steps to further develop our ESG program.  In 2021, we established formal board oversight of ESG by revising our Board committee charters, and in 2022, we advanced our approach to ESG by conducting 13 an ESG Priority Assessment to identify the ESG priority topics that are important to internal and external stakeholders.  In addition, in February 2023, we formed a management-level ESG Steering Committee comprised of representatives from various functions, including product development, engineering, operations, finance, human resources and purchasing.  The ESG Steering Committee was formed to (i) establish programs, policies and practices relating to ESG matters and (ii) assist the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to ESG matters. Going forward, we plan to publish our inaugural ESG report in 2023 and to work to identify and advance key ESG workstreams. "

            "Human Capital Management": "We believe we have a responsibility to foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization through sound ethical and organizational governance, by promoting business ethics and integrity, and by embracing equality, diversity, and inclusion throughout our organization and even extending to the board room. For additional information, see \u201cEnvironmental, Social & Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Initiatives\u2014Ethics & Corporate Responsibility,\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. We support employee action to protect the natural environment and the communities in which we operate through pollution prevention, conservation, responsible use, charitable giving, and sustainable practices. For example, we organize and engage employees in an annual charitable giving campaign. We work to ensure that our business practices support diversity and inclusion to build an innovative workforce and to strive toward having our organization reflect the complexion of our customers and suppliers. We are strengthening our diversity and inclusion programs with actions around organizational training, formalized company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy. As of December 31, 2022, we had 458 employees worldwide, including 158 field application engineers and consultants, 155 in research and development, 85 in sales and marketing, and 60 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 258 are located in the North America, 166 in Asia, and 34 in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in France and Italy are subject to collective bargaining agreements in those countries. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in our industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, sales, and technical employees. "
