            "Business Overview": "We provide comprehensive data solutions designed to empower organizations across the semiconductor ecosystem to improve the yield and quality of their products and operational efficiency for increased profitability. We derive revenues from two sources, Analytics and Integrated Yield Ramp. Our offerings contribute to Analytics revenue through contract fees for on-premise software and hardware system licenses, software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d), and other professional services. Certain of our Characterization services engagements contribute to Integrated Yield Ramp revenue through contract fees and a value-based, variable fee or royalty, which we call Gainshare. We are headquartered in Santa Clara, California and also operate worldwide with offices in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Our customers include Fortune 500 companies across the semiconductor ecosystem. These companies use our products and services to achieve various goals depending on whether they are integrated device manufacturers (\u201cIDMs\u201d), fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, equipment manufacturers, electronics manufacturing suppliers (\u201cEMS\u201d), original device manufacturers (\u201cODMs\u201d), out-sourced semiconductor assembly and test (\u201cOSATs\u201d), or system houses. For example, our foundry customers generate and analyze key manufacturing data using our solutions to shorten the time necessary for technology development and to provide their fabless customers with a higher yielding process with improved electrical performance, which are both critical metrics for market success. Higher yields in less time can also mean less total raw materials and process runs, which help lower customers\u2019 total cost and minimize environmental impact. Also, equipment manufacturers and factories use our connectivity products to implement evolving industry standards for their equipment or operations, respectively, with required quality and stability. By way of further example, our IDM and fabless customers use our solutions to generate unique, differentiated data that can be analyzed with our machine learning (\u201cML\u201d) and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) algorithms to predict downstream manufacturing issues, resulting in shorter time for designs to meet performance requirements with fewer iterations and faster time-to-market. For final example, our foundry and OSAT customers use the AI and ML applications of our software to optimize for process control, assembly, and/or test. Our mission is to provide innovative solutions to create, access, and organize data to enable analysis and control for semiconductor and electronics companies to achieve better time-to-market, yields, quality, and operational efficiencies. Our strategy to achieve this is as follows: \u2022  Offer a Common, Flexible Platform for a Broad Group of Customers Across the Supply Chain . As semiconductor and electronics products are made with the efforts of equipment manufacturers, front-end foundries, chip and system designers, design automation, intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) providers, and OSATs, there is a need to analyze the data across this whole chain to optimize yields, operational efficiencies, time to market, quality, and reliability. The Exensio platform is designed to provide a common platform - whether deployed in the cloud or on premise - to enable these different participants to analyze the relevant end-to-end data in near real-time, with data stores from 10s to 100s of terabytes (TBs) and flexible configurations for IDM, foundry, fabless, and OSAT specific needs. Our ML solutions combine professional services with the Exensio platform to further enable our customers to push their analytics \u201cto the edge\u201d of their global supply chains and shift the analysis and decision-making processes closer to where their data is being generated. We believe enabling edge analytics will further increase our customers\u2019 ability to improve product yield, quality, performance, and profitability, and therefore, should drive the market for our products and services. \u2022  Drive Tool-Level Software Installations to Create an Infrastructure of Connected Equipment and Enable Smart Factories . We believe that driving installation of our software products at the tool level will provide an infrastructure of connected equipment and help to enable smart factories. In July 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Advantest Corporation through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Advantest America, Inc., (collectively, \u201cAdvantest\u201d), and have since released Exensio analytics applications that run on Advantest test and computer hardware. In April 2022, we announced an additional collaboration with a leading back-end test and assembly provider. We believe these relationships will allow us to increase the network of tools connected with 5 PDF software and provide Advantest and other tool customers with increased data management and analytics. In December 2020, we acquired Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d) and began providing software products based on open standards for equipment control and connectivity to equipment manufacturers and factories. We believe that in the smart manufacturing era, the industry will demand the increased equipment connectivity and control our products and solutions offer. Further, we believe that the benefits from integration between analytics on equipment, the factory, and in the cloud will provide synergies with our existing end-to-end analytics offerings. \u2022  Create Differentiated Data Sources for Better Analytics . Historically, companies have only used data that was generated from their manufacturing and test process to drive improvements. We offer unique IP (such as Characterization Vehicle\u00ae test chips, also branded CV\u00ae test chips) that is not part of an IC\u2019s functionality, but significantly improves the manufacturing process by improving yield learning and reducing time to market. Also, our Design-for-Inspection\u2122 system (also branded DFI\u2122 system) identifies blockers that impact product yield and quality months earlier than any other hardware- or software-based methodology from proprietary e-beam measurement of product layout or provided on-chip instrumentation. We believe that in the More-than-Moore (\u201cMtM\u201d) era, the differentiated data we provide can play an important role in enabling our customers to bring new products to market faster and with higher quality and performance, and, ultimately, more profitability. \u2022  Collaborate with Other Industry Leaders to Bring Additional Unique Data to Our Platform and Enable New and Differentiated Applications . We believe that the value we bring to semiconductor manufacturing can be leveraged with additional data and through differentiated applications. For example, in December 2021, we announced a collaboration with Siemens to connect integrated circuit test and yield data with manufacturing and test data collected and managed by our Exensio\u00ae analytics platform, to enable customers to rapidly analyze and identify yield correlations that are otherwise undetectable quickly, and in some cases automatically. In July 2022, we announced a collaboration with SAP to connect factory data, including data collected and managed by our Exensio\u00ae analytics platform, to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) data in SAP S/4HANA\u00ae to enable greater efficiencies in semiconductor manufacturing. Relationships such as these are intended to provide more ways for mutual customers to leverage their process and product data as part of their Industry 4.0 initiatives. Differentiated applications that make use of this shared data are designed to provide unique insights to help customers achieve sustained profitability in their manufacturing. "

            "Brief History": "PDF Solutions was incorporated in Pennsylvania in November 1992, and we reincorporated in California in November 1995. In July 2000, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in July 2001, we completed an initial public offering. Our shares of common stock are currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cPDFS\u201d. From 2000 through 2009, we expanded our technology footprint and our operations in various countries through acquisitions. From 2009 to 2019, we primarily focused on the pervasive application of our technology to leading edge logic manufacturing and achieving yield targets with our clients that maximized Gainshare royalties. In 2013, we leveraged our extensive experience in yield simulation software and CV\u00ae test chip development and started research and development on an e-beam solution for non-contact, inline electrical inspection and process control for wafer inspection. The first-generation e-beam tool for DFI\u2122 was completed in 2015, and the second generation was commercially deployed in 2019. In a parallel effort, starting in 2014, we re-architected our point-solution software tools into a new generation, highly-integrated data analytics Exensio platform, which resulted in accelerated growth in our software business through 2019. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Cimetrix and began providing software products based on open standards for equipment control and connectivity to equipment manufacturers and factories.

            "Industry Background": "Rapid technological innovation with increasingly shorter product life cycles has fueled the economic growth of the semiconductor industry since the days of the PC revolution. IC companies have historically ramped production slowly, produced at high volume once a product gained market acceptance, and slowly reduced production volume when price and demand started to decrease near the end of the product\u2019s life cycle. Today there are many different business models across the semiconductor industry: products that follow the traditional life cycle just described, products targeted towards 6 fast-moving market segments like Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) \u2013 which utilize mature process nodes and requires a fast ramp to volume with a relatively short life cycle, and products focused on long term market segments like automotive and industrial where product life cycles can last a decade or longer. There is a lot of variation across these business models depending on the level of design complexity and the maturity of the process node used for product implementation. Processors, memory and field-programmable gate arrays (\u201cFPGA\u201d) continue to leverage the most advanced process nodes and experience significant challenges to achieve competitive initial yields and optimized performance. Some products and market segments, however, are content to utilize older process nodes. Regardless of the process node used for implementation or how long the product will be sold in the market, success for every semiconductor company is predicated, among other things, on fast product yield ramp and the ability to optimize manufacturing and test metrics, such as yield reclamation, product quality, and test efficiency, throughout a product\u2019s life cycle. Thus, technologies or capabilities that can accelerate yield ramp, improve product quality, and optimize production efficiencies are highly sought after because they typically lead to cost reduction and revenue generation concurrently, causing a leveraged effect on profitability.

            "Technology and Intellectual Property Protection": "Our success is largely dependent upon our proprietary software. We believe the creative skills and technological ability of our personnel, product enhancements, and new product development are necessary to maintaining our position as a leading provider. We rely primarily on trade secret rights, copyright and trademark laws, and nondisclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our technology. We seek to protect our IP under patent laws and as of December 31, 2022, we held 185 U.S. patents. Our issued patents have expiration dates from 2023 through 2041. We intend to prepare additional patent applications when we feel it is beneficial. We also employ protection of our trademarks, with registration of marks, including Characterization Vehicle, Cimetrix, CV, eProbe, Exensio, pdFasTest, PDF Solutions, and the PDF Solutions and Cimetrix logos. We have common law rights to additional trademarks, including ALPS, DFI, DirectProbe, DirectScan, FIRE, and VarScan. We also enter into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and confidentiality and license agreements with our customers and the various parties we partner with to resell, distribute, and, in some cases, integrate our products. Further, we limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Third parties could in any case develop competing technologies that include similar functionality or features, or otherwise are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries where we operate. Our business could suffer significantly if we fail to protect our proprietary technology. In addition, through yield, performance, and reliability improvement services over more than 20 years, we have accumulated a vast library of physical IP in the form of test structures. As part of our DFI and CV systems, our engineers create designs of experiments (\u201cDOEs\u201d) and layouts for targeted fail modes. We have also developed electrical measurement hardware tools and proprietary extraction, design, and analysis software. In addition, our technology embodies many production-proven and patented algorithms. Further, our IP includes proven methodologies that our implementation teams use as guidelines to drive our customers\u2019 use of our technology. We strive to continually enhance our core technologies through the codification of knowledge that we gain in the use of our products and delivery of services. "

            "Products and Services": "Products Our primary software products and software and hardware systems include the following: Exensio Platform . Our separately-offered Exensio software products address the big data manufacturing challenge of today\u2019s advanced process nodes and highly integrated products, by providing a common environment throughout the supply chain for different data types, including inline and end-of-line metrology, yield, parametric, performance, manufacturing consumables, tool-level sensor data, test floor data, logistical data, as well as custom data types. Exensio products are designed to enable real-time rapid diagnosis and understanding of key manufacturing and test metrics during both inline and end-of-line wafer processing, helping customers reduce product variability and cost simultaneously. By integrating silos of data and applying AI and ML, Exensio products resolve the limitation of local optimization and provide better foresight across the entire production process, reducing the time it takes to make critical decisions that can drive 7 higher product yield, quality and reliability. Our collaboration with strategic partners is intended to also integrate data from those partners\u2019 products to make it available in Exensio and also to develop new applications to inter-operate with those products and enhance the value to mutual customers. Exensio products are available as either an on-premise license or SaaS and are offered in four main, separately-offered Exensio products targeting the needs of the customer\u2019s business model: Exensio IDM, Exensio Fabless, Exensio Foundry, and Exensio OSAT. Each of these products are comprised of two or more modules to provide specific capabilities to address a particular type of company\u2019s needs and requirements; however, there are common features, functionality, and purpose across some of the key modules as follows: \u2022 Manufacturing Analytics \u2013 This module uses our proprietary database schema to store collected data in a common environment with a consistent view. For example, product engineers use it to identify and analyze production yield, performance, reliability and other issues. Elements of this module are designed to handle very large and complex data sets that are commonplace in the semiconductor industry. To support the multi-dimensional product requirements of our customers, the powerful, interactive visualization and analysis capabilities in this product are highly flexible and user-configurable. \u2022 Process Control \u2013 This module provides failure detection and classification (\u201cFDC\u201d) capabilities for monitoring, alarming, and control of manufacturing tool sets.

Test Operations is also designed to provide predictive insights based on proprietary analytics during test, assembly and packaging to maximize the efficiency of test operations, productivity improvements and yield reclamation. \u2022 Assembly Operations \u2013 This module provides the capability to link assembly and packaging data with other product lifecycle data, including fabrication and characterization data, across the product life cycle. Data sources could include manufacturing, wafer acceptance test, wafer sort, test and assembly, final test, and field use. The proprietary data linkage enabled by Assembly Operations is also designed to enable device manufacturers to maintain full traceability of their finished products back to the source wafer without the need for Electronic Chip IDs (\u201cECIDs\u201d). This capability is becoming an essential requirement for safety-critical market segments such as automotive and military-aerospace. Design-for-Inspection System. Our DFI\u2122 System leverages our production-proven design and analysis infrastructure and is designed to enable customers to achieve non-contact, inline electrical inspection of either our proprietary on-chip instruments or their product chip layout structures. The electrical measurements augment and enhance existing inline defect inspection and metrology methods for more effective process control and inline, direct inspection of product wafers. The DirectScan application of the DFI system includes our proprietary Exensio Characterization and Fire\u2122 layout analysis software and the eProbe\u00ae non-contact e-beam tool. The original application of the DFI system also included our on-chip instruments. These elements are described as follows: \u2022 Fire\u2122 Feature Analysis Software \u2013 This proprietary software, which may also be part of our Exensio platform, is designed to analyze layout features. In particular, this software helps to determine which parts of the product layout to inspect. \u2022 DFI On-Chip Instruments \u2013 Our on-chip measurement instruments are tuned to capture key features of our customers\u2019 product layouts. As part of the system offering, we generally provide design services to create these 8 instruments. These DFI instruments are designed to be placed in test chips, scribe lines, or in product die, without any area penalty, and to exhibit specific electrical responses. \u2022 eProbe\u00ae Non-Contact E-Beam Tool \u2013 Our eProbe e-beam tools are designed for contactless measurement of the electrical response of the DFI instruments and suitable product layout structures. As part of the system offering, we generally provide tool support services to customers to operate this tool. The third generation tool includes advances in accuracy and sensitivity and, in addition to enabling DFI on-chip instruments to be used for inline control for leading-edge semiconductor process nodes, is designed to enable customers to see defects in product wafers inline within acceptable queue time and much higher throughput. \u2022 Exensio Characterization Software \u2013 This software, which is also a part of our Exensio platform, is designed to analyze the billions of measurements collected using the eProbe tool. As part of the system offering, we generally provide to our customers analysis services, a summary of our findings and recommendations. Characterization Vehicle (\u201cCV\u201d) System. Our CV system is a combination of CV test chips, hardware to test such products, software to analyze the test results, and related services. This system is designed to accelerate the efficiency of yield learning by shortening the learning cycle, learning more per cycle, and reducing the number of silicon wafers required in manufacturing processes. This system includes physical IP in the form of test structures and DOEs that are tuned to our customers\u2019 product and/or process specifics, tester hardware, data analysis, and training. The primary software and hardware products included in the CV system are as follows: \u2022 CV Test Chips \u2013 Our proprietary test chips are designed by our professional engineers using our proprietary FIRE\u2122 layout analysis software. These test chips are run through a customer\u2019s manufacturing process, with intentional process modifications, to provide unique, differentiated data to explore the effects of potential process improvements given natural manufacturing variations. Our custom-designed CV test chips are optimized for our test hardware and analysis software and include DOEs tuned to each customer\u2019s process. Types of CV test chips include: \u2022 Our full-reticle and shared-reticle CV test chips are designed to provide a fast-learning cycle and are fully integrated with third-party failure analysis and inspection tools for a complete diagnosis to understand root causes. Our full-reticle CV test chips use a shortened process flow to provide a faster learning cycle for specific process modules. \u2022 Our Scribe CV test chip are inserted directly on customers\u2019 product wafers to collect data about critical layers. \u2022 Our DirectProbe\u2122 CV test chips are designed to enable ultra-fast yield learning for new product designs by allowing our clients to measure components of actual product layout. \u2022 Our VarScan\u2122 CV test chips are designed for front-end or through-silicon via (\u201cTSV\u201d) application with a focus on high resolution resistance variation analysis for mass production. \u2022 pdFasTest \u00ae Electrical Tester \u2013 Our proprietary test hardware is optimized to quickly test our CV test chips, enabling fast defect and parametric characterization of manufacturing processes. As part of the system offering, we provide test programs for each CV test chip that are tuned to the customer\u2019s process. This automated system provides parallel functional testing, thus minimizing the time required to perform millions of electrical measurements to test our CV test chips. We provide services to analyze the unique, differentiated data output of this tester using the Exensio Characterization software to provide actionable insights to our customers. \u2022 Exensio Characterization software \u2013 This software, which is also a part of our Exensio platform, collects the data generated from our CV test products, generating models of the performance effects of process variations on these design building blocks. As part of the system offering, we also offer analysis services, if the customer elects not to do such analysis itself. 9 Cimetrix\u00ae Software Products . Our Cimetrix software products enable equipment manufacturers to provide industry standard interfaces on their products for efficient equipment communication, control, and collection of equipment data. There are numerous industry standards that have been established for equipment connectivity and control, including the SEMI defined SECS (SEMI Equipment Communication Standard), GEM (Generic Equipment Model), and PV2 (new photovoltaic equipment communication standard based on SECS/GEM) standards. By providing software products that fully support these industry standards, equipment manufacturers can implement robust, turnkey support for these connectivity and control standards without needing to invest engineering resources to develop their own interfaces to these standards. Factories that purchase manufacturing equipment enabled with Cimetrix-supported interfaces, benefit from consistent and robust implementations of industry standards, enabling faster and more efficient implementation of smart manufacturing initiatives that depend on the collection and analysis of manufacturing and product data. There are two separate Cimetrix product lines targeting the needs of factory equipment connectivity and control. The products are sold via perpetual licenses and runtime royalties. \u2022 Equipment Factory Connectivity \u2013 Our products for equipment factory connectivity primarily include the following: \u2022 CIMConnect \u2122 is designed for general purpose equipment connectivity and enables production equipment in the semiconductor and electronics industries to communicate data to the factory\u2019s host computer through the SECS/GEM and PV2 standards. CIMConnect can also support other emerging communications standards for maximum flexibility. In addition, it supports multiple-host interfaces simultaneously, which allows customers to support legacy, custom, and GEM interfaces. CIMConnect is used in semiconductor wafer fabrication, semiconductor back-end (test, assembly, and packaging), PV, HB-LED, disk drive, flat panel displays, printed circuit boards and other electronics manufacturing. \u2022 CIM300 \u2122 is a software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) used by manufacturers of 300mm semiconductor equipment that is designed to enable quick implementation of the required 300mm SEMI standards, including E39, E40, E87, E90, E94, E116, E148, and E157. These SEMI standards allow for the full automation required in manufacturing 300mm wafers. \u2022 CIMPortal \u2122 Plus is an SDK for equipment manufacturers that allows for quick implementation of the Interface A, also known as EDA (Equipment Data Acquisition), which includes SEMI standards E120, E125, E132, E134, E138, E147, and E164. Interface A specifies a new port on equipment that provides detailed structured data that can be used for advanced process control, e-diagnostics, and other equipment engineering service applications. These software applications are becoming critical to the fabs as shorter ramp times are required. \u2022 Equipment Control \u2013 Our equipment control product is the CIMControlFramework \u2122 (\u201cCCF\u201d) software, which is based on Microsoft.NET technology. It is designed to enable equipment manufacturers to meet the supervisory control, material handling, platform and process control, and factory automation requirements of the fabrication facilities or fabs. Developers can leverage framework components through configuration and extension or customize when unique requirements exist. CCF, unlike one-off solutions, is supported and maintained with upgrades, improvements, and performance enhancements. With a data-driven architecture at the core of the framework, data generated at any point on the equipment is designed to be quickly and easily accessed by any other module or external application. Services Our services are almost always sold together with, or to support, our products and include the following: Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) . We provide services to make our Exensio software available to our customers via the Internet, generally hosted by third-party providers. SaaS is considered part of cloud computing since the software is hosted on the Internet, or the \u201ccloud.\u201d Since our SaaS applications are accessed from a remote server rather than installed on individual machines, it is easier to maintain. For example, when the remote software is updated, the customer\u2019s interface is also updated for all users. Cloud computing is designed to eliminate incompatibilities between different software 10 versions and allow us to make incremental updates without requiring software downloads. Additionally, our customers can save data to a central online location, which is designed to allow increased project collaboration. As part of these services, we also typically provide hosted management services for the licensed software and the customer\u2019s data stored in our cloud. These services include environment set-up and configuration, system health monitoring, data integration maintenance, integration monitoring, system updates, security, and data upload/download, and license administration. Software Related Services . We provide software maintenance and support (\u201cM&S\u201d), data management services, various value-added services (\u201cVAS\u201d) to install, configure, or create analysis templates, and other professional services to achieve customers\u2019 specific outcomes using our software. We call this last type of services our solutions offering and, in these cases, we tailor the use of one or more Exensio products to achieve a desired result. For example, our AIM YieldAware\u2122 FDC solution offering is designed to identify the process control variables that have the greatest impact on product yield through professional services that analyze the data from both Exensio Process Control and elements of Exensio Manufacturing Analytics and make recommendations for the customer to implement. VAS are provided by our professional service personnel with expertise that enhances and complements the engineering teams at our customers. For example, VAS includes our data cleaning and monitoring services. One requirement of big data analytics is to have clean, harmonized data to analyze. This service offering outsources the data wrangling and management effort to free the customer to focus their efforts on analysis, which has a greater ROI to the company than data management. Characterization Services . These services are designed to characterize key product and/or process elements, primarily into CV test structures or DFI on-chip measurement instruments, and typically do not include performance incentives based on the customers\u2019 yield achievement. We provide these services, typically together with all elements of our CV system, to foundry customers in connection with new process technology development and/or yield ramp. In Characterization engagements, we generally provide the analysis of our CV test chips and provide summary findings and recommendations to the customer. Characterization engagements can include DFI systems. "

            "Competition": "The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing prices. We expect market competition to continue to develop and increase as the market for data and analytics continues to evolve. We believe IC companies benefit from a combination of big data management infrastructure, AI/ML-based analytics engines, and products that generate and collect differentiated data that enrich the analytics process. Currently, we are a leading provider of comprehensive commercial hardware, software and IP solutions for optimizing and improving design, manufacturing and test operations processes through the application of differentiated data and advanced analytics. We face indirect competition from internal groups at IC companies that offer tools with varying degrees of optimization to accelerate process-design integration or test operations. Some providers of semiconductor manufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their product offerings and compete with us. In addition, companies providing general ML and analytics software may focus on semiconductor companies and compete with us. In each of the market segments we compete in, we face competition from established and potential competitors, some of whom may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We currently face indirect competition from the internal groups at IC companies and direct competition from providers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA Corporation (\u201cKLA\u201d), Siemens AG (\u201cSiemens\u201d), Onto Innovation, Inc. (\u201cOnto\u201d), and Synopsys, Inc. (\u201cSynopsys\u201d); (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Inc (\u201cApplied Materials\u201d), Synopsys, Invantest, Inc., NI, Inc., Onto, and Siemens; (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as ASML Holding N.V. (\u201cASML\u201d), Applied Materials, KLA,  and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity software or integration products/services supporting factory equipment connectivity or control needs of customers, such as PEER Group, Inc., Kontron AIS, GmbH, Yokogawa Electric Corp., Advantest, and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There may be other providers of competitive commercial solutions of which we are not aware, and we may compete with the products or offerings of these named companies or additional companies if we expand our offerings through acquisition or development. For example, through our acquisition of Cimetrix in late 2020, we now face competition in the connectivity and integration products/services supporting factory equipment 12 connectivity or control. The demand for solutions that address the need for better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competitors to enter into our market. For example, in 2020, two of our competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys acquired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, and each has increased marketing or pricing competition with us. This competition in our market may intensify in the future, which could lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting our revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose to develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet market needs. These and other competitors may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than our engineering organization, which would give any such competitor\u2019s products a competitive advantage over our solutions. We believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to competition because we have demonstrated results and reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innovative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new technology and product generations. See the discussions in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Item 1A for more information about risks associated with our competition. "

            "Information Security and Risk Oversight": "We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to provide our products and services to our customers. As a result, we have developed an information security program (our \u201cInfoSec Program\u201d) to enhance our network security measures, identify and mitigate information security risk, and protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of critical information owned by us and that of our customers and suppliers that is in our care. Our InfoSec Program includes development, implementation, and continual improvement of policies and procedures to safeguard information and ensure availability of critical data and systems. The program also includes annual information security awareness training for employees involved in our systems and processes that handle customer data and audits of our systems and enhanced training for specialized personnel and we have instituted regular phishing email simulations for all employees and all contractors with access to corporate email systems to enhance awareness and responsiveness to such possible threats. Our InfoSec Program further includes review and assessment by external, independent third-parties, who certify and report on our weaknesses and internal response preparedness with respect to the entire company. Accordingly, we have instituted periodic network access penetration (\u201cPEN\u201d) testing no less than once per year both for our corporate network resources and our SaaS cloud-based offerings. In May 2022, we successfully completed our annual Type II System and Organization Control (\u201cSOC 2\u201d) audit of our cloud-based offerings under the framework put forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d) in which independent, third-party auditors assess and test controls relating to the Trust Services Criteria (\u201cTSC\u201d) of Security, Availability, and Confidentiality and no qualified findings were found during the audit period. In January 2023, we started our next annual Type II SOC 2 audit with external auditors and continued the audit process leading to ISO 27001 certification. To date, we have not managed ITAR-designated data, technology, or information. In accordance with our InfoSec Program, we also actively monitor known threats that could affect our products and services and work with our suppliers to provide us with real-time reports of threats or vulnerabilities that may affect our enterprise-wide systems. Our InfoSec Program also includes a data security incident response plan that provides controls and procedures for timely and accurate reporting of any material cybersecurity incident. As described in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is tasked with oversight of certain risk issues, including cybersecurity. The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors, two of whom have significant work experience related to information security issues or oversight. Management reports security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and provides a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee as well as the full Board about periodic assessment of our InfoSec Program, our internal response preparedness, and assessments led by outside advisors. We carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial and included no penalties or settlements. "

            "Environmental, Social & Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Matters": "We have recently taken key strategic steps to further develop our ESG program.  In 2021, we established formal board oversight of ESG by revising our Board committee charters, and in 2022, we advanced our approach to ESG by conducting 13 an ESG Priority Assessment to identify the ESG priority topics that are important to internal and external stakeholders.  In addition, in February 2023, we formed a management-level ESG Steering Committee comprised of representatives from various functions, including product development, engineering, operations, finance, human resources and purchasing.  The ESG Steering Committee was formed to (i) establish programs, policies and practices relating to ESG matters and (ii) assist the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to ESG matters. Going forward, we plan to publish our inaugural ESG report in 2023 and to work to identify and advance key ESG workstreams. "

For additional information, see \u201cEnvironmental, Social & Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Initiatives\u2014Ethics & Corporate Responsibility,\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. We support employee action to protect the natural environment and the communities in which we operate through pollution prevention, conservation, responsible use, charitable giving, and sustainable practices. For example, we organize and engage employees in an annual charitable giving campaign. We work to ensure that our business practices support diversity and inclusion to build an innovative workforce and to strive toward having our organization reflect the complexion of our customers and suppliers. We are strengthening our diversity and inclusion programs with actions around organizational training, formalized company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy. As of December 31, 2022, we had 458 employees worldwide, including 158 field application engineers and consultants, 155 in research and development, 85 in sales and marketing, and 60 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 258 are located in the North America, 166 in Asia, and 34 in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our employees in France and Italy are subject to collective bargaining agreements in those countries. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in our industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, sales, and technical employees. "

        {
            "Risks Associated with Our Business": "We have invested significant resources into research and development of our DFI system and Exensio platform and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives on the expected timeline or at all, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. As part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments in research and development efforts to develop our DFI system and Exensio cloud-based platform. New competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitorsor other competitive factors may require us to further invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. There can be no guarantee that the technologies or products that we invest in will result in products that create additional revenue. We may not recoup our research and development investments, which could cause our results to suffer. If our DFI system and Exensio platform do not anticipate technological changes in our industry or fail to meet market demand, we may not capture the market share we anticipate, lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. Our sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering into contracts or decide not to adopt our products or solutions after we have performed services or supported their evaluation of our technology, which could result in delays in recognizing revenue and could negatively impact our results of operations in a quarter or result in lower revenue than we expected if a contract is not consummated. On-going negotiations and evaluation projects for new products, with new customers or in new markets may not result in significant revenues for us if we are unable to close new engagements on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner, or at all. Unexpected delays in our sales cycle could cause our revenues to fall short of expectations. Further, the timing and length of negotiations required to enter into agreements with our customers and the enforcement of our complex contractual provisions is difficult to predict. If we do not successfully negotiate certain key complex contractual provisions, if there are disputes regarding such provisions, or if they are not enforceable as we intended, our revenues and results of operations would suffer. Further, our customers sometimes delay starting negotiations until they begin developing a new process, have a need for a new product, or experience specific yield issues. This means that, on occasion we have, and may continue to provide technology and services under preliminary documentation before executing the final contract. In these cases, we would not recognize revenue and may defer associated costs until execution of a final contract, which, if significant, could negatively impact our results of operations in the periods before we execute a final contract. Further, if we were to incur significant costs and then fail to enter into a final contract, we would have to write-off such deferred costs in the period in which the negotiations ended, which would increase our costs and expenses and could result in significant operating losses. Our fixed-fee services or product or system installations/configurations may take longer than budgeted, which could slow our revenue recognition and may also result in a lost contract or a claim of breach by our customers, which would negatively affect our operating results. Our fixed-fee services, including for characterization, require a team of engineers to collaborate with our customers to address complex issues by using our software and other technologies, and the installation and configuration of our software into our customers\u2019 fabrication and test/assembly facilities requires experienced engineers working with our customers on active foundry and test/assembly equipment. We must accurately estimate the amount of resources needed to complete these types of services to determine when the engineers will be able to commence their next engagement. In addition, our accounting for contracts with such services, which generate fixed fees, sometimes requires adjustments to profit and loss based on revised estimates during the performance of the contract. These adjustments may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which they are made. The estimates giving rise to these risks, which are inherent in fixed-price contracts, include the forecasting of costs and schedules, and contract revenues related to contract 16 performance. If we fail to meet a customer\u2019s expectations in either case, the customer could claim that we breached our obligations, which could result in lost revenue and increased expenses. Our ability to sell our products, systems, and solutions depends in part on the quality of our support and services offerings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and services could negatively affect our sales and results of operations. Once our products are integrated within our customers\u2019 hardware and software systems, our customers may depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. Further, in connection with delivering our SaaS, which requires us to maintain adequate server hardware and internet infrastructure, including system redundancies, we are required to meet contractual uptime obligations. A high level of system and support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not effectively provide subscription access to our SaaS customers, assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post- deployment issues, and provide effective on-going support and the privacy and data security capabilities required by our customers, we may face contractual penalties or customers may not renew subscriptions or services in the future, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, due to our international operations, our system and support organization faces challenges associated with delivering support, hours that support is available, training, and documentation where the user\u2019s native language may not be English. If we fail to maintain high-quality support and services or fail to adequately address our customers\u2019 support needs, our customers may choose our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours in the future, which would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. Defects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software tools, and failure to effectively remedy any such defects could decrease our revenue and our competitive market share. If the software, hardware, or proprietary technologies we provide to customers contain defects that negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to use our systems or software, increase our customers\u2019 cost of goods sold or time-to-market, or damage our customers\u2019 property, such defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance of our products and services or could result in warranty or other claims. We must adequately train our new personnel, especially our customer service and technical support personnel, to effectively and accurately, respond to and support our customers. If we fail to do this, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our customers, which could slow our growth. Further, the cost of support resources required to remedy any defects in our technologies, hardware, or software tools could exceed our expectations. Any actual or perceived defects with our software, hardware, or proprietary technologies may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers, leading to a decrease in our revenue. These defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new software, hardware, or proprietary technologies or enhancements to existing software, hardware, or proprietary technologies, which means that we may not discover the errors or defects until after customer implementation. If our software, hardware, or proprietary technologies contain errors or defects, it could require us to expend significant resources to remedy these problems or defend/ indemnify claims, which could reduce margins and result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other customer implementations and development efforts. Objectionable disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential information or our failure to comply with our customers\u2019 security rules, including for those related to SaaS access or our on-site access could result in costly litigation, cause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-going business with existing customers. Our customers consider their product yield and test information and other confidential information, which we collect in the ordinary course of our engagement with the customer or through our software tools, including data and personal data about our customers\u2019 employees necessary to administer the licenses, to be extremely competitively sensitive or subject to strict protection frameworks. Many of our customers have strict security rules for on-site access to, hosting of, or transfer of their confidential information. As a result of increased regulatory and customer scrutiny of all data processing activities, as well as increasing and evolving regulation of such practices, we have security obligations on how we collect, transfer and use data (including personal data), which could require us to expend money and resources to comply with those requirements, and if compromised, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the potential for regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, lawsuits and a loss of business and a degradation of our reputation. If we suffer an unauthorized intrusion or we inadvertently disclose or are required to disclose this information, or disclose this information in a manner that was objectionable to our customers, 17 regulators, consumer protection groups, or privacy groups, or if we fail to adequately comply with customers\u2019 security protocols for accessing or hosting confidential information, our reputation could be materially adversely affected, we could lose existing and potential customers or could be subject to costly penalties or litigation, or our on-going business could be negatively impacted and insurance to cover such situations may not fully cover our exposure. If we fail to implement industry standard protections and processing procedures, the growing awareness of our customers and potential customers regarding privacy and data security requirements and/or adverse media coverage or regulatory scrutiny could limit the use and adoption of our services. In addition, to avoid potential disclosure of confidential information to competitors, some of our customers may, in the future, ask us not to work with key products or processes, which could limit our revenue opportunities. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and a large percentage of our revenues from two customers, so defaults or decreased business with, or the loss of, any one of these customers, or pricing pressure, or customer consolidation could significantly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively impact results of operations. Historically, we have had a small number of large customers that contribute significant revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 41% of our total revenues. We have in the past and could in the future lose a customer due to its decision not to develop or produce its own future process node or not to engage us on future process nodes. We could also lose customers as a result of industry factors, including but not limited to reduced manufacturing volume or consolidation. Consolidation among our customers could also lead to increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. Further, new business may be delayed if a key customer uses its leverage to push for terms that are worse for us and we delay entering into the contract to negotiate for better terms, in which case revenue in any particular quarter or year may fail to meet expectations. Also, the loss of any of these customers or the failure to secure new contracts with these customers could further increase our reliance on our remaining customers. Further, if any of our key customers default, declare bankruptcy or otherwise delay or fail to pay amounts owed, or we otherwise have a dispute with any of these customers, our results of operations would be negatively affected in the short term and possibly the long term. For example, in 2022, 2021 and 2020 we incurred expenses in the amount of $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the arbitration with SMIC New Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation due to SMIC\u2019s failure to pay fees due to us under a series of contracts. In early 2023, we will incur substantial additional expenses related to an arbitration hearing to resolve this matter. The loss of revenue from any of our key customers would cause significant fluctuations in results of operations because our expenses are fixed in the short term and it takes us a long time to replace customers or reassign resources. If we do not continuously meet our development milestones of key research and development projects or successfully commercialize our Design-for-Inspection system, our future market opportunity and revenues will suffer, and our costs may not be recouped. We have invested significantly in the design and development of our eProbe tool and related IP. Key customers failing to purchase, renew, or expand the number or use of such systems on our expected timeline or at all will cause our results to miss expectations. Also, if the results of our DFI system, including new applications, are not as we expect, we may not be able to successfully commercialize this system or such applications on schedule, or at all, and we may miss the market opportunity and not recoup our investment. Further, our eProbe tool could cause unexpected damage to wafers or delay processing wafers, which we could be liable for, or which could make customers unwilling to use it. If we are not able to create significant interest and show reliable and useful results without significant damage to wafers, our investment may not be recouped and our future results may suffer. We are required to comply with governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets. We are required to comply with export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that restrict selling, shipping or transmitting our products and services and transferring our technology outside the United States. These 18 requirements also restrict domestic release of software and technology to foreign nationals. In addition, we are subject to customs and other import requirements that regulate imports that are important for our business. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Export Administration Regulations or other U.S. or non-U.S. export or economic sanctions laws and regulations (collectively, \u201cExport Regulations\u201d), we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for the Company and the possible loss of the ability to engage in exporting and other international transactions. Due to the nature of our business and technology, Export Regulations may also subject us to governmental inquiries regarding transactions between us and certain foreign entities. Export Regulations are fluid, complex, and uncertain, and there are ongoing efforts throughout the industry in coordination with regulators to revise, clarify, and interpret Export Regulations. The U.S. Congress and regulators continue to consider significant changes in laws and regulations. We cannot predict the impact that additional legal changes may have on our business in the future. For example, in October 2022 the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) promulgated broad, novel Export Regulations relating to China that temporarily caused us to pause some deliveries while we interpreted the application of the new regulations on our business, given current and evolving operations.  Also, BIS has placed certain entities on its entity list (the \u201cEntity List\u201d), which restricts supply of items to or in connection with the named entities. Further, in some circumstances Export Regulations require a license to export an item if the recipient will use the item to design or produce an item for a Huawei-affiliated company or certain other organizations on the Entity List. These regulations can also require licenses for exports that involve Chinese military or intelligence-related end users or end uses. Future changes in Export Regulations, including changes in the enforcement and scope of such regulations, may create delays in the introduction of our products or services in international markets or could prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or services globally. In some cases, such changes could prevent the export of our products or services to certain countries, governments, entities or individuals altogether. Any such delays or restrictions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion, see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Decreases in wafer volumes at our customers\u2019 manufacturing sites or the volume of ICs that some of our customers are able to sell to their customers would cause our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue to suffer. Our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue includes amounts largely determined by variable wafer volumes at manufacturing sites covered by our contracts and, in some cases, determined by the volume of an IC product that our customer is able to sell to its customers. Both of these factors are outside of our control. We have seen a significant reduction in our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue in recent years and expect this trend to continue. Further, some of our manufacturing customers\u2019 business is largely dependent on customers that use our manufacturing customer as a second or third source. If those customers consolidate and/or otherwise move the orders to manufacturing facilities not covered by our contracts, or suspend their manufacturing at covered facilities for any reason, including consolidation, our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue will continue to decrease, which could negatively affect our financial results. Further, reduced demand for semiconductor products or protectionist policies like those stemming from the complex relationships among China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States has from time to time decreased and may continue to decrease the volume of wafers and, in some cases, products our customers are able to make or sell, which would also decrease our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue. Also, our customers may unilaterally decide to implement changes to their manufacturing processes during the period that volume is covered by royalty contracts, which could negatively affect yield results and, thus, our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue. Since we currently work on a small number of large projects at specified manufacturing sites and, in some cases, on specific IC products, our results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by negative changes at those sites or in those products, including slowdowns in manufacturing due to external factors, such as U.S. trade restrictions, rising inflation and global interest rates, the impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, or continued or worsening supply chain disruptions. Also, if wafer orders from sites covered by our contracts are not secured by our customers, if an end product does not achieve commercial viability, if a process line or, in some cases, a specific product, does not achieve significant increases in yield or sustain significant volume manufacturing during the time we receive royalties, revenues associated with such volumes or products would be negatively impacted. This could significantly reduce our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue and our results of operations could fail to meet expectations. In addition, if we 19 work with two directly competitive manufacturing facilities or products, volume in one may offset volume, and thus any of our related revenue, in the other facility or product. Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, which actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results. Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions, which has and could continue to require us to increase headcount, acquire new companies or engage in restructurings from time to time. For example, while we have increased investment in our business by increasing headcount, acquiring companies, and increasing our investment in R&D, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business from time to time, at other times we have undertaken restructuring  initiatives to reduce expenses and align our operations with evolving business needs. Some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or headcount. Rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected Our business may be impacted by geopolitical events and uncertainties, war, terrorism, or other business interruptions beyond our control. Geopolitical uncertainties, including relations between the United States and each of China and Russia, war, terrorism, or other business interruptions could cause damage to, disrupt, or cancel sales of our products and services on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or vendors with which we do business. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; escalating U.S.- China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China; and unexpected governmental regulations and restrictions in China as a result of renewed or increased efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which could negatively impact our local operations. Such events could also make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In addition, territorial invasions can lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology companies, such as ours, located far outside of the conflict zone. In the event of prolonged business interruptions or negative broad economic and security conditions due to geopolitical events, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time, and experience significant expenditures in order to resume our business operations. In addition, our insurance policies typically contain a war exclusion of some description and we do not know how our insurers are likely to respond in the event of a loss alleged to have been caused by geopolitical uncertainties. Global economic conditions or semiconductor market conditions could materially adversely impact demand for our products and services, decrease our sales, or delay our sales cycle. Our customers are global semiconductor companies, which means that our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions as well as semiconductor market specific changes. Uncertainty about global economic conditions including war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties and other business interruptions could result in damage to, disruption, postponement or cancellation of sales of our products or services on a global or regional basis. Furthermore, tighter credit, higher interest rates, inflationary concerns, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values and other macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and, accordingly, on our business, results of operations or financial condition and/or vendors with which we do business. For example, the timing of the build-out of the semiconductor market in China depends significantly on governmental funding on both local and national levels and a delay in this funding could negatively affect 20 our revenues. Further, any economic and political uncertainty caused by the United States tariffs imposed on goods from China or enhanced U.S. export regulations relating to China, among other potential countries, and any corresponding tariffs from China or such other countries in response, may negatively impact demand and/or increase the cost for our products. Similarly, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in China or in other nations has and may continue to cause a slowdown in the global economy and demand for our products and services. Further, the semiconductor industry historically has been volatile with up cycles and down cycles, due to sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers\u2019 IC products by consumers, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. As a result of the various factors that affect this volatility, the timing and length of any cycles can be difficult to predict and could be longer than anticipated. Any of these events could negatively affect our revenues and make it challenging or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may also lead to additional bad debt expense. Supply-chain disruptions could impact our ability to build additional hardware tools or meet customer deadlines. Disruptions to our supply chain may significantly increase our component costs and could impact our ability to build additional hardware tools, which would decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to: rising inflation and global interest rates increasing component costs, a closure or slowdown at our suppliers\u2019 plants or shipping delays including, for example, those made to combat the spread of COVID-19, market shortages for critical components, increases in prices, the imposition of regulations, quotas, embargoes or tariffs on components or our products, labor stoppages or shortages, supply chain disruptions, third-party interference, cyberattacks, severe weather conditions including the adverse effects of climate change-related events, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism, and disruptions in utilities and other services. In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage our supply of components and products could adversely affect our business. "

            "Risks Related to Our Technology": "If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, customers or potential competitors may be able to use our technologies to develop their own solutions, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenues, or increase our costs. Our success depends largely on the protection of our proprietary technology. Our contractual, patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be effective against any particular threat or in any particular location. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for IP and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. Litigation may be necessary from time to time to enforce our IP rights. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also divert our resources, including our managerial and engineering resources. If we are unable to exclude others from using our proprietary technologies and methods without compensation to us, through litigation or otherwise, it could impede our ability to grow our business and our revenues may suffer. We are exposed to risks related to information technology infrastructure, information management and protection, cybersecurity threats, and cyber incidents. We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to provide our products and services to our customers. Additionally, we must frequently expand our internal information system to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and communication, which may result in increased costs. Our internal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers\u2019 information that we transmit. Building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on 21 our management and resources. These demands may divert these resources from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy. We rely on service providers to enable key services to our customers, including for cloud services, enterprise software, customer support portal software, and co-location computing facilities and have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, interruptions in our information systems on which our global operations depend or unplanned downtime of the infrastructure that delivers our SaaS. Such an unplanned interruption, even if temporary, could stop SaaS customers from accessing their hosted data or on-premise customers from downloading licensed software or critical security patches, or from accessing our support portal, which could mean that we may not meet our contractual commitments for such services to customers, which could reduce our revenue or result in damage to our reputation and negatively impact future sales. Further, the information technology and infrastructure that stores and processes our and our customers\u2019 data is susceptible to continually evolving cybersecurity threats that become more complex over time and may not be recognized until launched against a target, all of which could result in unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, our data, and interruption or disruption of our business. We and our third-party service providers, with whom we may share data, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or may not implement adequate preventative measures to prevent either unauthorized access to our systems or services that could compromise customer data or other confidential information or result in a disruption of our services. In particular, our industry is often the target of cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive data, including customer confidential information, or to disrupt our ability to provide services from a broad range of threat actors, including foreign governments, criminals, competitors, computer hackers, cyber terrorists and politically motivated groups or individuals. The security measures we have integrated into our internal systems, SaaS, and software products, which are designed to detect unauthorized intrusions or activity and prevent or minimize security breaches, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to protect our internal networks, SaaS, and software products against certain attacks and other security incidents and attacks of varying degrees from time to time. In some cases, we do not have contracts to provide legal protection or recourse for breaches of our security protections, which may increase our exposure to expenses related to such attacks and negatively impact our results. Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational loss, diversion of funds, and may result in fines, litigation and unwanted media attention. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting payments. Territorial invasions like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or other geopolitical events can lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology companies, such as ours, located far outside of the conflict zone. In the event of prolonged business interruptions due to a security breach or disruption, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume our business operations. Our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cyber-related security breaches, and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering, misuse, criminal acts including phishing, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate. Our security measures may also be circumvented or bypassed due to employee errors or malfeasance. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, including account credentials, customer personnel information, or other information. If we fail to have adequate controls or safeguards, the security of our internal networks, electronic systems, or physical facilities could be compromised, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure, a loss of confidence in the security of our SaaS and other software products, interruptions, or malfunctions in our operations, account lock outs, and, ultimately, harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance policies may not cover losses incurred in the event our systems or data are comprised, and they are subject to retention amounts that could be substantial. Moreover, we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. If we experience a security event, we may have to conduct an investigation and notify individuals, customers, partners, service providers and state, federal and local governmental authorities and regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere around the globe.  Accordingly, security events could lead to significant costs and fees for legal advice, investigation support, 22 remediation, and result in legal risk exposure, damage and harm to our reputation, and impact on our ability to keep and attract customers. We and our customers are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy, data security, consumer protection, and advertising and these laws and regulations are continually evolving, which exposes us to potential material risks. We collect, use, store or disclose (collectively, \u201cprocess\u201d) personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. In the United States, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the processing of information about individuals, including federal laws (e.g., FTC Act) and state privacy laws (e.g., the California Privacy rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act), marketing and communications laws, laws regarding credit reports, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws, many of which carry significant potential for active enforcement and penalties. Abroad, our customers may be subject to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR or similar local or regional frameworks that impose a strict data protection compliance regime. Our customers may impose these obligations on us by contract, which could require us to expend resources to comply with those requirements. More generally, given the rapidly changing data privacy and data security laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations discussed above, and because any current compliance is subject to change based on this shifting and inconsistent landscape, we could incur costs of complying with these laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by our customers, other private parties in addition to government entities, are high and likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows and our geographic scope and member base expands. The impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. Our technologies could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights. Significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the semiconductor industry. It is possible that a third party may claim that our technologies infringe their intellectual property rights or misappropriate their trade secrets. which has happened in the past. Any claim, even if without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could adversely affect our sales opportunities, expenses, and revenues. Competition in the market for data analytics and related systems and services may intensify in the future, which could impede our ability to grow or execute our strategy. We currently face indirect competition from the internal groups at IC companies and direct competition from providers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA, Siemens AG (\u201cSiemens\u201d), Onto Innovation, Inc. (\u201cOnto\u201d), and Synopsys, Inc. (\u201cSynopsys\u201d); (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Inc., Synopsys, Invantest, Inc., NI, Inc., Onto, and Siemens; (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as ASML, Applied Materials, KLA, and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity software or integration products/services supporting factory connectivity or control needs of customers, such as PEER Group, Inc., Kontron AIS, GmbH, Yokogawa Electric Corp., Advantest, and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There may be other providers of competitive commercial solutions of which we are not aware and we may compete with the products or offerings of these named companies or additional companies if we expand our offerings through acquisitions or development. For 23 example, since our acquisition of Cimetrix Incorporated in late 2020, we now face competition in the products/services supporting the connectivity, control and integration of factory equipment. The demand for solutions that address the need for better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competitors to enter our market. For example, in 2020, Synopsys, Inc. acquired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, and have increased marketing and pricing competition with us. This competition in our market may intensify in the future, which could lead to increased pricing pressure, negative impacts on our revenues, or a decreased ability to grow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose to develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet market demands. These and other competitors may be able to operate with a lower cost structure, which would give any such competitor\u2019s products a competitive advantage over our solutions. "

            "Risks Related to Our Operations": "Measurement of our variable consideration requires data collection and customers\u2019 use of estimates in some cases and is subject to customers\u2019 agreement and is later offset if actual data differ from customers\u2019 estimates, which can result in uncertainty and cause quarterly results to fluctuate. We can only recognize volume- or average selling price (\u201cASP\u201d)- based royalties once we have reached agreement with our customers on their level of yield performance improvements or ASP and quarterly agreements are sometimes based on estimates of volume results or ASP for each quarter. Measuring the amount of yield improvement is inherently complicated and dependent on our customers\u2019 internal processes and certain non-public information. Thus, there may be uncertainty as to some components of measurement or calculation. Also, some variable consideration can be highly susceptible to delays in the customer measurement of key factors such as reporting volumes results and level of yield or ASP. Therefore, we may have to estimate revenue related to contingent variable fees or usage- or sales-based royalties prior to the receipt of performance reports, such as royalty acknowledgements, or other related information from customers. These estimates are subject to judgment to evaluate whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods, which could result in our recognition of less Integrated Yield Ramp revenue than expected that may later be offset when actual results become available. We have customers with past due balances and our failure to collect a significant portion of such balances could adversely affect our cash, require us to write-off receivables, or increase our expense or bad debt allowance. If our customers fail to pay receivable balances when due, our cash will decrease and we may have to incur additional expenses in an attempt to collect it, write-off a portion or all of such receivables, or increase our bad debt allowance. Our accounts receivable balance, net of reserves, was $42.2 million and $40.1 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Unbilled accounts receivable, included in accounts receivable, totaled $13.5 million and $11.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unbilled accounts receivable that are not expected to be billed and collected during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded in other non-current assets and totaled $0.8 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Three customers accounted for 53% of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022, and two customers accounted for 44% our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. The total accounts receivable reserve was $0.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We generally do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. Despite the financial ability of these customers to pay for on- going services by PDF under valid contracts, customers may delay payments. Our allowances for potential credit losses, if any, could be insufficient, and we may need to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts from current estimates or write-off receivables depending on such claims in the future. If we are forced to pursue legal remedies to collect receivables, our expenses could rise significantly and our business relationship and future business with these customers could suffer. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected how we and our customers operate and could continue to adversely impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect how we and our customers operate our businesses. For example, most U.S. states and countries worldwide imposed, restrictions on the physical movement of our employees, partners, and customers to limit the spread of COVID-19. Our US headquarters and R&D facility and offices in Canada, France, Japan and Korea experienced temporary closures. In addition, our personnel worldwide have also been subject to various country 24 to country travel restrictions, which limit our ability to provide services to customers at their facilities. These impacts have disrupted our normal operations. If the COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees\u2019 productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. Moreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our products or services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, adversely impact our ability to provide or deliver products and on-site services to our customers, delay the provisioning of our offerings, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. For example, we believe the lack of in-person interactions during most of 2020, 2021, and 2022 made it harder for us to sell complex or new technologies to such customers during these periods. The duration and extent of the continuing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that remain difficult to predict, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus and variants thereof, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including the availability and effective distribution of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, or if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy continue to worsen or the industries in which we operate are negatively impacted over the long-term, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. We face operational and financial risks associated with international operations that could negatively impact our revenues. In recent years, we have derived over half of our revenues from sales outside of the United States, and we expect our international business to continue to grow. We have in the past expanded and reorganized, at different times, our operations, including international operations, and may in the future continue such expansions or reorganizations by establishing or restructuring international subsidiaries, offices, or contractor relationships in locations, if and when, deemed appropriate by our management. Thus, the success of our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including in particular: \u2022 our potential growth in China is dependent upon continued investments in the semiconductor industry by both private and public entities within China. Should circumstances change such that the level of investments is substantially reduced, our future growth potential may be limited; \u2022 some of our key engineers and other personnel are foreign nationals and they may not be permitted access to certain technical information under U.S. export laws or by certain of our customers and may have difficulty gaining access to the United States and other countries in which our customers or our offices may be located and it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees in foreign offices; \u2022 ineffective or inadequate protection or enforcement of our IP in foreign jurisdictions; \u2022 greater difficulty in collecting account receivables resulting in longer collection periods, bad debt, and increased costs to collect; \u2022 language and other cultural differences may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems between our U.S. and foreign teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations and negatively impacting sales and revenue; \u2022 compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar including, among others, issues related to human resources, personal data, tax, protection of our IP, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law; 25 \u2022 currency risk due to certain of our payables and our international offices\u2019 payables are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Euro, Yen, and RMB, while predominantly all of our revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, or in the event a larger portion of our revenues becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk; \u2022 inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; \u2022 additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; \u2022 geopolitical instability or changes in government could disrupt our operations or our customers\u2019 purchases or operations or those of related supply chain participants; \u2022 quarantine, travel restrictions, or business disruptions in regions affecting our operations, stemming from actual, imminent or perceived outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19; or \u2022 economic or political instability, including but not limited to armed conflict, terrorism, interference with information or communication of networks or systems, including strained or worsening relations between the United States and China, occupation or war involving Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting disruption to economic activity and business operations. Further, our employees and contractors include professionals located in various international locations, including Shanghai, China and Ramallah, Palestine, and Taiwan who provide software-related development, quality assurance, maintenance, and other technical support services for certain of our software products. Conflicts in these regions or impacting these regions, or policy changes, including policies covering export controls, that affect these or other international operations could disrupt or limit the work our employees and contractors perform and may negatively affect the range of services we are able to provide or our cost for such services. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has affected the manufacturing and shipment of goods. From time to time since the start of the pandemic in 2020, our offices around the world have been temporarily shut down and restrictions have limited the ability of our local employees to travel to customer sites or visit our other offices. An extended closure of our customers\u2019 plants due to a resurgence of COVID-19 or its variants could adversely impact our business. In addition, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy, and labor relations. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated, or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. We may incur substantial expense in complying with new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. If we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. Additionally, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. A significant violation could significantly negatively impact our sales opportunities, operations, and financial results. Even if our operations and ability to deliver products and services to customers in China and elsewhere are not significantly negatively impacted by such changing regulations, our customers in China and elsewhere may decide to use only local vendors as a precaution. In such case, our expected international business may be slower than expected or not materialize at all, in which case, our sales opportunities, operations, and financial results would suffer. Further, the U.S. government has imposed broad sanctions on Russia, Belarus and certain companies and high-wealth individuals relating to the invasion of Ukraine, and has additionally maintained a bipartisan consensus favoring increased confrontation of China on trade practices and economic matters, national security, and human rights. The current U.S. 26 Administration views technology as a domain of strategic competition in which the U.S. and its allies must stay ahead of China and has identified semiconductor, artificial intelligence, 5G technologies, and the protection of U.S. supply chains as priority efforts. As a result of these government actions and policies, unless and until related restrictions are lifted, we are generally not able to supply many products, services and technologies to affected entities and countries. Our standard operations include development, distribution processes, software download sites, and professional service centers and processes located in various geographies around the world. Some customers have expressed concerns that continued action by the U.S. government could potentially interrupt their ability to make use of our products or services. The continuing tension between the U.S. government and each of the Chinese and Russian governments in trade and security matters or the perception of that tension could lead to further disruptions or reductions in international trade, deter or prevent customer purchasing activity, and may negatively impact our financial results. Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters that could expose us to numerous risks. We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self- regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market and FASB. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on ESG initiatives, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC\u2019s proposed climate-related reporting requirements. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.

            "Tax Risks": "U.S. federal tax reform and changes in foreign tax laws could change our tax burden and adversely affect our business and financial condition. We conduct our business globally and, as a result, are subject to taxation in the United States and foreign countries. Our future tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, insufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in accounting policies. Our filings are subject to reviews or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We cannot be sure that any final determination in an audit would not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit, there could be a significant negative effect on our income tax provision and our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments, could materially increase our effective tax rate. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States. The IR Act includes a 15% minimum tax rate, as well as tax credit incentives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The details of the computation of the tax and implementation of the incentives will be subject to regulations that have not yet been released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. On August 9, 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (the \u201cCHIPS 27 Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States to provide certain financial incentives to the semiconductor industry, primarily for manufacturing activities within the United States. We are continuing to monitor the IR Act and CHIPS Act and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business and operating results. For further discussion of the IR Act and CHIPS Act, see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. Future events may impact our deferred tax asset position, including the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income in the applicable jurisdiction. We previously recorded a full valuation allowance against all of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the future realization of these deferred tax assets. Therefore, no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets. The net operating loss and tax credits could expire unused and be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability each reporting period. The impact of releasing some or all of such valuation allowance in a future period could be a material benefit in the period in which such release occurs. "

            "Risks Related to Our Strategic Transactions": "We may devote significant time and resources to developing strategic relationships but we may not realize the benefits of such efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have in the past devoted, and plan in the future to devote, time and resources to identifying, developing, and promoting strategic relationships with other suppliers to provide combined, integrated, or interoperable solutions to the semiconductor, electronics, and automotive industries. For example, from July 2020 through January 2023, we announced strategic relationships or collaborations with Advantest Corporation, Siemens, Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc., SAP SE, and proteanTecs Ltd.. The full extent of the future impact of these strategic relationships on our financial condition and results of operations is currently unknown and the failure to reap the anticipated benefits of these companies\u2019 financial resources, technology, customer relationships, and global footprint and/or to successfully develop combined, integrated, or interoperable solutions with such companies could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our acquisitions create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results. Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. To this end, we have, from time to time, engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions, and, from time to time, acquiring one or more businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We may choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products, technologies and/or services instead of developing them ourselves. For example, we acquired Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d) in December 2020 for a gross purchase price of approximately $37.5 million ($31.6 million net of cash acquired) for all of its outstanding equity. We may, however, face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources, making it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions. We may not be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms and we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate. Integrating any business, product, technology or service into our current operations could be expensive and time-consuming and/or disrupt our ongoing business. Further, there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions, including, but not limited to, problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, liabilities, litigation, and diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners, failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, and the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners of the companies we acquire. 28 We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire and the transaction may not advance our business strategy. The integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions. If we fail to successfully manage, operate, or integrate any acquired business or if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, including through the use of common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, we could be required to write-down investments and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. We may also be unable to protect or enforce the IP rights of any target business that we acquire, or such target businesses may become subject to claims of IP infringement. Further, if we become subject to liabilities as a result of an acquisition, the liabilities we incur may be substantial and the amounts of such liabilities may not be covered by and/or may exceed any liability protections. In connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock, or assume equity awards, that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders, use a substantial portion of our cash resources, assume liabilities (both known and unknown), record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

            "General Risk Factors": "If we are not able to retain, attract, motivate, and strategically locate talented employees, including some key executives, our business may suffer. Our success and competitiveness depend on our ability to retain, attract, motivate, and strategically locate in our offices around the globe, talented employees, including some of our key executives. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, changes in our management or leadership, the hiring practices at our competitors or customers, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our recruiting and compensation programs, including equity-based programs. Further, we have had, and expect to continue to have, difficulty in obtaining visas permitting entry for some of our employees that are foreign nationals into the United States, and delays in obtaining visas permitting entry into other key countries, for several of our key personnel, which disrupts our ability to strategically locate our personnel. In the past the United States has and, in the future, the United States may again increase the level of scrutiny in granting H-1(b), L-1 and other business visas. Compliance with United States immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals. If we lose the services of certain of our key executives or a significant number of our engineers, it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy. If we do not successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, including key executives, we may be unable to realize our business objectives and our operating results may suffer. Our earnings per share and other operating results may vary quarter to quarter, which could result in not meeting investors\u2019 expectations and stock price volatility. Our stock price has fluctuated widely during the last few years. A factor in the volatility may be that our historical quarterly operating results have fluctuated. Our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future period, which could cause our stock price to decrease again. A significant reduction in our stock price negatively impacts our ability to raise equity capital in the public markets and increases the cost to us, as measured by dilution to our existing shareholders, of equity financing. In addition, the reduced stock price also increases the cost to us, in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee compensation or for acquisitions of other businesses. A greatly reduced stock price could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, a hostile take-over bid, and fewer business development opportunities. Also, significant volatility in our stock price could be followed by a securities class action lawsuit, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. 29 Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities. In recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies, including our company. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of a company. Such proposals may disrupt our business, increase our expenses, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.

            "Overview": "We offer products and services designed to empower organizations across the semiconductor ecosystem to connect, collect, manage, and analyze data about design, equipment, manufacturing, and test to improve the yield and quality of their products. We derive revenues from two sources: Analytics and Integrated Yield Ramp. Our offerings combine proprietary software, professional services using proven methodologies and third-party cloud-hosting platforms for SaaS, electrical measurement hardware tools, and physical IP for IC designs. We primarily monetize our offerings through license fees and contract fees for professional services and SaaS. In some cases, especially on our historical IYR engagements, we also receive a value-based variable fee or royalty, which we call Gainshare. Our products, services, and solutions have been sold to IDMs, fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, OSATs, capital equipment manufacturers, and system houses. Industry Trend Certain trends may affect our Analytics revenue specifically. In particular, the confluence of Industry 4.0 (i.e., the fourth industrial revolution, or the automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes) and cloud computing (i.e., the on-demand availability of computing resources and data storage without direct active management by the user) is driving increased innovation in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing and analytics, as well as in the organization of IT networks and computing at semiconductor and electronics companies across the ecosystem. First, the ubiquity of wireless connectivity and sensor technology enables any manufacturing company to augment its factories and visualize its entire production line. In parallel, the cost per terabyte of data storage has continually decreased year to year. The combination of these two trends means that more data is collected and stored than ever before. Further, semiconductor companies are striving to analyze these very large data sets in real-time to make rapid decisions that measurably improve manufacturing efficiency and quality. In parallel, the traditional practice of on-site data storage, even for highly sensitive data, is changing. The ability to cost-effectively and securely store, analyze, and retrieve massive quantities of data from the cloud versus on-premise enables data to be utilized across a much broader population of users, frequently resulting in greater demands on analytics programs. The combination of these latter two trends means that cloud-based, analytic  33 programs that effectively manage identity management, physical security, and data protection are increasingly in demand for insights and efficiencies across the organizations of these companies. We believe that all these trends will continue for the next few years, and the challenges involved in adopting Industry 4.0 and secure cloud computing will create opportunities for our combination of advanced analytics capabilities, proven and established supporting infrastructure, and professional services to configure our products to meet customers\u2019 specialized needs. Other trends may continue to affect our characterization services business and Integrated Yield Ramp revenue specifically. The logic foundry market at the leading-edge nodes, such as 10nm, 7nm, and smaller, underwent significant change over the past few years. The leading foundry continues to dominate market share as other foundries started later than originally forecast in some cases. This trend will likely continue to impact our characterization services business on these nodes. We expect most logic foundries to invest in derivatives of older process nodes, such as 28nm and 14nm, to extract additional value as many of their customers will not move to advanced nodes due to either technological barriers or restrictive economics. Foundries that participate at leading edge nodes are expected to continue to invest in new technologies such as memory, packaging, and multi-patterned and extreme ultraviolet lithography, as well as new innovations in process control and variability management. We expect China\u2019s investment in semiconductors to continue. Compliance with changing U.S. export restrictions limit our possible business with Chinese semiconductor manufacturers on advanced nodes with our electrical characterization offering. As a result of these market developments, we have chosen to focus our resources and investments in products, services, and solutions for analytics. There are other global or business trends that may affect our business opportunities generally as follows: \u2022  Continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic . Although COVID-19 pandemic restrictions are being eased worldwide, the pandemic continues to affect how we and our customers operate our businesses. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation with a focus on our employees\u2019 safety as our employees who were working in-office prior to COVID-19 have continued to return to working in-office for a certain number of days each week, subject to any current and future local restrictions. In addition, our personnel worldwide have in the past been and, in the future, may become subject to various country-to-country travel restrictions, which limits the ability of some employees to travel to other offices or customer sites. We believe the lack of an ability to meet in person during most of 2020, 2021 and to some degree the first half of 2022 made it harder for us to sell complex or new technologies to some customers during these periods. As we continue to meet with these customers in person, we believe we may improve traction with them. To date, we have been able to provide uninterrupted access to our products and services due to our globally distributed workforce, many of whom were working remotely prior to the pandemic, and our pre-existing infrastructure, which supports secure access to our internal systems. The total duration and full extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the ultimate severity and transmission rate of the virus and its variants, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and vaccinations, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. To date, one effect of the COVID- 19 pandemic is a global shortage in semiconductors due primarily to supply chain disruptions and some market segments, including automotive semiconductors, continue to have shortages in production. Although COVID-19 related shortages have not materially affected our business, this trend may affect our future business opportunities, particularly future Gainshare and Cimetrix run-time licenses, if our customers\u2019 production volumes decrease. \u2022  Continuing demand for consumer electronics . For instance, the demand for consumer electronics, communications devices, and high-performance computing continues to drive technological innovation in the semiconductor industry as the need for products with greater performance, lower power consumption, reduced costs, and smaller size continues to grow with each new product generation. In addition, advances in computing systems and mobile devices continue to fuel demand for higher capacity memory chips. To meet these demands, IC manufacturers and designers are constantly challenged to improve the overall performance of their ICs by designing and manufacturing ICs with more embedded applications to create greater functionality while lowering power and cost per transistor. As this trend continues, companies will continually be challenged to improve process capabilities to optimally produce ICs with minimal random and systematic yield loss, which is driven by the lack of compatibility between the design and its respective manufacturing process. We believe that these difficulties will continue to create a need for our products and services that address yield loss across the IC product life cycle. For further instance, the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war is negatively impacting the global supply chain 34 and global energy markets, which has resulted in inflation, supply chain shortages and rising prices. Ukraine and Russia are both top suppliers of neon gas that is used in lasers and chip manufacturing, and Russia is a major producer of palladium, a rare metal used in computer components, sensors, and fuel cells. Limitations on the supply of these two elements can severely affect the global supply chain, which is already scarce. Russia also supplies much of the world\u2019s premium nickel, which is used by electronics manufacturers to make batteries. If these trends continue or worsen, we or our customers may face a shortage of critical components and our business may suffer. Rising prices of semiconductors may mean increased royalties to us and increased Integrated Yield Ramp revenue. We are also actively monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the potential impact of inflationary pressures and increasing global interest rates, for impacts on our material, labor and other costs. \u2022  Changing export controls and sanctions . The U.S. government continues to expand and intensify export controls and sanctions. This includes the addition of many People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cP.R.C.\u201d) and Russian companies to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) Entity List or Unverified List. These listings restrict supply to designees of items that are subject to the EAR. After an internal evaluation, we determined that a large percentage of our software products are not of U.S. origin and are, thus, not subject to the EAR. Our standard operations include development, distribution processes, software download sites, and professional service centers and processes located in various geographies around the world to better serve our customers. Some customers in the P.R.C., in particular, have nonetheless expressed concerns to us that continued action by the U.S. government could potentially interrupt their ability to make use of our products or services. In October 2022, the U.S. government issued an interim final rule (87 Fed. Reg. 62186) with additional export control restrictions. Among several changes, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on supply to any P.R.C. fabrication facility that produces certain advanced logic or memory ICs, when the supply involves a commodity, software or technology (\u201cItem\u201d) that is \u201csubject to the EAR\u201d or when the supply involves a \u201cU.S. person\u201d even if the Item is not \u201csubject to the EAR.\u201d Another change is a restriction on supply of an item \u201csubject to the EAR\u201d destined for use in the development or production of certain IC manufacturing equipment and certain parts and components of such equipment in the P.R.C.  Industry members, including our Company, continue to generate questions and evaluate the effects of the new regulations. The U.S. government has committed to \u201crolling guidance\u201d to resolve issues and answer questions in the coming months. In addition, the U.S. government expanded the \u201cforeign direct product rules,\u201d and thus EAR jurisdiction and restrictions, to additional foreign- produced Items and in connection with additional restricted parties in the P.R.C. Based on our current assessments, we expect the impact of these expanded trade restrictions on our business to be limited. We will continue to monitor for any further trade restrictions, other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. or foreign governments and any actions in response, and remain committed to complying with applicable law. The uncertainty caused by these recent regulations and the potential for additional future restrictions could, nonetheless, negatively affect our future sales in the P.R.C. market. \u2022  Geopolitical tensions . Geopolitical tension between the U.S. and P.R.C. continues to increase, with both governments taking actions and making statements that lean in the direction of confrontation, including on the issue of Taiwan. Growing tension also increases risk of unintended mishap, mistake, or accident leading to escalation and global supply chain disruption. The continuing tension between the U.S. and P.R.C. and/or Russian governments in trade and security matters or the perception of that tension could lead to disruptions or reductions in international trade, deter or prevent purchasing activity of customers, and negatively impact our China sales (with respect to U.S.-P.R.C. tensions) and financial results in general (with respect to global tensions). Financial Highlights The following are our financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2022: \u2022  Total revenues were $148.5 million, an increase of $37.5 million, or 34%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Analytics revenue was $130.5 million, an increase of $37.1 million, or 40%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Analytics revenue was driven by increases in revenue from CV and DFI systems and increases in revenues from Exensio and Cimetrix software licenses. Integrated Yield Ramp revenue increased $0.4 million, or 2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to 35 an increase in hours worked on fixed fee engagements, partially offset by the end of Gainshare periods on certain contracts. \u2022  Costs of revenues increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs, subcontractor costs, third-party cloud- delivery costs, and software licenses and maintenance costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases in facilities and information technology-related costs, including depreciation expenses, and hardware costs. \u2022  Net loss was $3.4 million, compared to a $21.5 million net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net loss was primarily attributable to an increase in total revenues, other income from net foreign currency exchange gain and interest income, a decrease in write-downs in value of property and equipment, decreases in property tax expense and depreciation expense, partially offset by increases in costs of revenues and operating expenses related primarily to our research and development, sales and marketing activities, and general and administrative expenses, which were primarily driven by increases in personnel-related costs, cloud-services related costs, subcontractor costs, and legal expenses, and an increase in income tax expense. \u2022  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $1.0 million to $139.2 million at December 31, 2022, from $140.2 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to cash used to repurchase shares of common stock and payment for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, and for the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from purchases under our employee stock purchase plans.

            "Critical Accounting Estimates": "The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from two sources: Analytics and Integrated Yield Ramp. Analytics Revenue Analytics revenue is derived from the following primary offerings: licenses and services for standalone Software (which consists primarily of Exensio and Cimetrix products), SaaS (which consists primarily of Exensio products), and DFI and CV systems (including Characterization services) that do not include performance incentives based on customers\u2019 yield achievement. Revenue from standalone software is recognized depending on whether the license is perpetual or time-based. Perpetual (one-time charge) license software is recognized at the time of the inception of the arrangement when control transfers to the customers, if the software license is distinct from the services offered by us. Revenue from post-contract support is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis, because we are providing (i) support and (ii) unspecified software updates on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. Revenue from time-based- licensed software is allocated to each performance obligation and is recognized either at a point in time or over time as follows. The license component is recognized at the time when control transfers to customers, with the post-contract support component recognized ratably over the committed term of the contract. For contracts with any combination of licenses, support, and other services, distinct performance obligations are accounted for separately. For contracts with 36 multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) attributed to each performance obligation. Revenue from SaaS arrangements, which allow for the use of a cloud-based software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software, is accounted for as subscriptions and is recognized as revenue ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the subscription period beginning on the date the service is first made available to customers. Revenue from DFI systems and CV systems (including Characterization services) that do not include performance incentives based on customers\u2019 yield achievement is recognized primarily as services are performed. Where there are distinct performance obligations, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their SSPs. For these contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using SSP attributed to each performance obligation. Where there are not discrete performance obligations, historically, revenue is primarily recognized as services are performed using a percentage of completion method based on costs or labor-hours inputs, whichever is the most appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. The estimation of percentage of completion method is complex and subject to many variables that require significant judgment. Integrated Yield Ramp Revenue Integrated Yield Ramp revenue is derived from our yield ramp engagements that include Gainshare or other performance incentives based on customers\u2019 yield achievement. Revenue under these project\u2013based contracts, which are delivered over a specific period of time typically for a fixed fee component paid on a set schedule, is recognized as services are performed using a percentage of completion method based on costs or labor-inputs, whichever is the most appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. Where there are distinct performance obligations, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their SSPs and allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using SSP. Similar to the services provided in connection with DFI systems and CV systems that are contributing to Analytics revenue, due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of percentage of completion method is complex and subject to many variables that require significant judgment. The Gainshare royalty contained in yield ramp contracts is a variable fee related to continued usage of our IP after the fixed-fee service period ends, based on the customers\u2019 yield achievement. Revenue derived from Gainshare is contingent upon our customers reaching certain defined production yield levels. Gainshare royalty periods are generally subsequent to the delivery of all contractual services and performance obligations. We record Gainshare as a usage-based royalty derived from customers\u2019 usage of intellectual property and record it in the same period in which the usage occurs. Income Taxes We are required to assess whether it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that we will realize our deferred tax assets. If we believe that they are not likely to be fully realizable before the expiration dates applicable to such assets, then to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, we determined a full valuation allowance was still appropriate for our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d), primarily driven by a cumulative loss incurred over the 12-quarter period ended December 31, 2022, and the likelihood that we may not utilize tax attributes before they expire. The valuation allowance was approximately $59.2 million and $51.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and may change our conclusion in a future period based on changes in facts (e.g., 12-quarter cumulative profit, significant new revenue, etc.). If we conclude that we are more likely than not to utilize some or all of our U.S. DTAs, we will release some or all of our valuation allowance and our tax provision will decrease in the period in which we make such determination. We evaluate our DTAs for realizability considering both positive and negative evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax 37 planning strategies and any carryback availability. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. Changes in the net DTAs, less offsetting valuation allowance, in a period are recorded through the income tax provision and could have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Our income tax calculations are based on the application of applicable U.S. federal, state, and/or foreign tax law. Our tax filings, however, are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities. Accordingly, we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely- than-not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued, the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. At December 31, 2022, no deferred taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings from our international subsidiaries. We intend to reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations indefinitely. As such, we have not provided for any foreign withholding taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. The earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are taxable in the U.S. in the year earned under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income rules implemented under 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was signed into U.S. law on August 16, 2022. The Act includes various tax provisions, including an excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of $1 billion. While the details of the computation of the tax and implementation of some of the incentives will be subject to regulations that have not yet been released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Company does not expect the Act to materially impact its financial statements. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act (the \u201cCHIPS Act\u201d) was signed into U.S. law on August 9, 2022. CHIPS Act is intended to increase domestic competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing capacity, increase research and development in computing, artificial intelligence, clean energy, and nanotechnology through federal government programs and incentives over the next ten years. The CHIPS Act includes an advanced manufacturing tax credit equal to 25% of qualified investments in property purchased for an advanced manufacturing facility. We are evaluating the potential benefits of CHIPS Act to our business. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method, which requires us to measure stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The fair value of our restricted stock units is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. These awards are subject to time-based vesting which generally occurs over a period of four years. The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life is based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options granted. The interest rate assumption is based upon observed Treasury yield curve rates appropriate for the expected life of our stock options. 38 Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the business combination. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. The estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. As part of a prior acquisition, we recorded at the time of the acquisition acquired IPR&D for a project in progress that had not yet reached technological feasibility. Acquired IPR&D is initially accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and tested annually for impairment. Once the acquired IP R&D asset becomes available for use, it will be amortized over the estimated useful life or will be written off upon abandonment. Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill and Intangible Assets We record goodwill when the purchase consideration of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets as of the date of acquisition. We have one operating segment and one operating unit. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or more frequently, if required to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount of excess, limited to the amount of total goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, consist of property, equipment, and intangible assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment . For assets to be held and used, we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset group is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. There was no impairment of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. In fiscal 2021, we wrote down the value of property and equipment aggregating $3.2 million pertaining to our first-generation of e-beam tools for DFI\u2122 systems where carrying values may not be fully recoverable due to lack of market demand and future needs of our customers for these tools. Leases We have operating leases for our administrative and sales offices, research and development laboratory and clean room. We recognize our long-term operating lease rights and commitments as operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, non-current, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets, and operating lease liabilities are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease terms include 39 the minimum unconditional term of the lease, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain at the commencement date that such options will be exercised. The decision to include these options involves consideration of our overall future business plans and other relevant business economic factors that may affect our business. Since the determination of the lease term requires an application of judgment, lease terms that differ in reality from our initial judgment may potentially have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, our leases do not provide an implicit rate. In determining the present value of our expected lease payments, the discount rate is calculated using our incremental borrowing rate determined based on the information available, which requires additional judgment.

The increase in Analytics revenue was primarily driven by increases in revenues from CV and DFI systems and from Exensio and Cimetrix software licenses. Integrated Yield Ramp Revenue Integrated Yield Ramp revenue was $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $0.4 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due an increase in hours worked on fixed fees engagements, partially offset by the end of Gainshare periods on certain contracts. Our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue may continue to fluctuate from period to period primarily due to the contribution of Gainshare royalty, which is dependent on many factors that are outside our control, including among others, continued 40 production of ICs by our customers at facilities at which we generate Gainshare, sustained yield improvements by our customers, and whether we enter into new contracts containing Gainshare. Our revenues may also fluctuate in the future due to other factors, including the semiconductor industry\u2019s continued acceptance of our products, services and solutions, the timing of purchases by existing and new customers, cancellations by existing customers, our ability to attract new customers and penetrate new markets, supply chain challenges and further penetration of our current customer base. Fluctuations in future results may also occur if any of our significant customers renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments, including due to adverse changes in their own business. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues consist primarily of costs incurred to provide and support our services, costs recognized in connection with licensing our software, information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) and facilities-related costs and amortization of acquired technology. Service costs include material, personnel-related costs including compensation, employee benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, subcontractor costs, overhead costs, travel, and allocated facilities-related costs. Software license costs consist of costs associated with cloud-delivery related expenses and licensing third-party software used by us in providing services to our customers in solution engagements or sold in conjunction with our software products. The increase in costs of revenues of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to (i) a $2.6 million increase in personnel-related costs due to worldwide salary increases, increases in benefit costs, stock-based compensation expense, and bonus expense, (ii) a $1.6 million increase in third-party cloud-delivery costs, software licenses and maintenance costs, and (iii) an $0.8 million increase in subcontractor costs. These were partially offset by (i) a $1.0 million decrease in facilities and IT-related costs including depreciation expense and (ii) a $0.4 million decrease in hardware costs. Gross Margin Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 68% compared to 60% for the year ended December 31, 2021, or an increase of 8 percentage points. The higher gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to higher total revenue and decreases in certain costs of revenues, as discussed above, which decreased the costs of revenues as a percentage of total revenues, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Research and development expenses increased 28% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) a $9.9 million increase in personnel-related costs primarily resulting from increases in stock-based compensation expense, headcount, bonus expense, benefit costs, and worldwide salary increases, (ii) a $1.5 million increase in subcontractor expenses primarily related to Cimetrix and Exensio software, and DFI and CV systems, (iii) a $0.4 million increase in facilities and IT-related costs including depreciation expense, and (iv) a $0.4 million increase in travel expense. 41 We anticipate our expenses in research and development will fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period as a result of the size and the timing of product development projects.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to (i) a $7.3 million increase in personnel-related costs mainly resulting from increases in stock-based compensation expense, headcount, bonus and commission expense, benefit costs, and worldwide salary increases, (ii) a $1.2 million increase in facilities and IT-related costs including cloud-services related costs, (iii) a $0.4 million increase in general legal expenses, and (iv) a $0.3 million increase in travel expense. These were partially offset by (i) a $0.9 million decrease in subcontractor expenses, (ii) a $0.4 million decrease in property tax expense, and (iii) a $0.2 million decrease in accounting and auditing fees. We anticipate our selling, general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period as a result of cost control initiatives and to support increased selling efforts in the future.

Any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, new or changing tax legislation in the United States and in foreign countries where we are subject to tax jurisdictions, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, our ability to use tax attributes such as research and development tax credits and net operation losses, the tax effects of employee stock activity, audit examinations with adverse outcomes, changes in general accepted accounting principles and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

            "Liquidity and Capital Resources": "As of December 31, 2022, our working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $135.2 million, compared to $144.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, on a consolidated basis, were $139.2 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $140.2 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries were $8.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively. We believe that our existing cash resources and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our cash requirements to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other obligations, for at least the next twelve months. Cimetrix Acquisition On December 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Cimetrix with total payments made in fiscal 2021 and 2020 of $31.6 million, net of cash acquired. The net cash payment for this acquisition, which also included the settlement of the adjusted Holdback Amount, as discussed below, was funded from the available cash of the Company. 43 In 2020, the Company held back $3.5 million of the purchase price (the \u201cHoldback Amount\u201d) to satisfy adjustments and claims for indemnity arising out of breaches of certain representations, warranties and covenants, and certain other enumerated items in the merger agreement. During 2021, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment that reduced the Holdback Amount to $3.1 million. The measurement period adjustment did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Holdback Amount, as adjusted, was paid to the participating equity holders in December 2021. See Note 4 of \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d (Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report) for further discussion. Repurchase of Company\u2019s Common Stock On June 4, 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program (the \u201c2020 Program\u201d) to repurchase up to $25.0 million of the Company\u2019s common stock both on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, over the next two years. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 251,212 shares under the 2020 Program at an average price of $18.01 per share for an aggregate total price of $4.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 218,858 shares under the 2020 Program at an average price of $26.40 per share, for a total price of $5.8 million. In total, the Company repurchased 470,070 shares under the 2020 Program at an average price of $21.91 per share, for a total price of $10.3 million. On April 11, 2022, the Board of Directors terminated the 2020 Program, and adopted a new program (the \u201c2022 Program\u201d) to repurchase up to $35.0 million of the Company\u2019s common stock both on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, over the next two years. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 714,600 shares under the 2022 Program at an average price of $23.36 per share, for a total price of $16.7 million.

Cash generated from operating activities increased by $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $18.1 million decrease in net loss, a $7.8 million increase in net change from operating assets and liabilities, and a $2.2 million increase in non-cash adjustments to net loss, which mainly resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $6.7 million and an increase in amortization of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in loss on disposal and write- 44 down in value of property and equipment of $3.2 million, a decrease in deferred taxes of $1.4 million and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million. The major contributors to the net change in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022, were as follows: \u2022  Accounts receivable increased by $2.1 million, primarily due to an increase in sales, an increase in unbilled accounts receivables due to timing of billing and revenue recognition and higher contractual invoicing activity, partially offset by collections from customers; \u2022  Prepaid expense and other current assets increased by $5.8 million, primarily due to the timing of billing of contract assets related to fixed-price service contracts, and increase in deferred costs to obtain contracts with customers, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses related to third party software licenses and cloud- subscription related costs and a decrease in income tax receivable; \u2022  Other non-current assets decreased by $2.3 million primarily due to the amortization of non-current prepaid expenses and lower unbilled accounts receivable; \u2022  Accounts payable decreased by $1.4 million primarily due to the timing of payments of vendor invoices; \u2022  Accrued and other liabilities increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the timing of vendor invoices, accrued legal fees and accrued income taxes; \u2022  Accrued compensation and related benefits increased by $7.7 million primarily due to accrued bonuses and unused vacation; and \u2022  Deferred revenues increased by $1.8 million and billings in excess of recognized revenues increased by $1.9 million, primarily due to the timing of billing and revenue recognition. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities primarily related to proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $151.5 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $58.3 million, and purchases of and prepayments for property and equipment of $8.4 million primarily related to our DFI systems and CV systems. For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities primarily related to (i) purchases of $168.6 million short-term investments, (ii) a $3.1 million payment of the Holdback Amount related to the acquisition of Cimetrix, (refer to above discussion on Cimetrix Acquisition for further details), and (iii) $4.1 million for equipment purchased and prepayment for the purchase of property and equipment, primarily related to our DFI systems, partially offset by $171.0 million proceeds from maturities of short-term investments. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $22.5 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and $6.5 million in cash payments for taxes related to net share settlement 45 of equity awards, partially offset by $4.7 million of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plans and exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of $4.5 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and $4.0 million in cash payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $3.0 million of proceeds from purchases under our employee stock purchase plans and the exercise of stock options.

            "all_text": "The following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not currently own any equity investments, nor do we expect to own any in the foreseeable future. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors. Interest Rate Risk. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $139.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash, highly liquid money market instruments and U.S. Government securities. Short-term investments consisted of U.S. Government securities. We would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest on our portfolio. A hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points from the market rates in effect at December 31, 2022, 46 would cause the fair value of these investments to decrease by an immaterial amount which would not have significantly impacted our financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2022 and periodically throughout the year, we have maintained cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. We limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution by evaluating the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we invest and investing through more than one financial institution. Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk. Certain of our receivables and payables for our international offices are denominated in the local currency, including the Euro, Yen and RMB. Therefore, a portion of our revenues and operating expenditures are subject to foreign currency risks. From time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We record these forward contracts at fair value. The counterparty to these foreign currency forward contracts is a financial institution that we believe is creditworthy, and therefore, we believe the credit risk of counterparty non-performance is not significant. The change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in earnings as a component of other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income (expense), net. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding forward contracts.  47 Item 8. "

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d), and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion.

            "Basis for Opinion": "These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Assessment of Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

            "Critical Audit Matter": "The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives revenue from Analytics and Integrated Yield Ramp Revenue. Contracts with customers can include various combinations of licenses, subscriptions, products and services, some of which are distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. Significant  48 judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for customer agreements, including determining whether licenses, subscriptions, and services are distinct performance obligations, determining the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) attributed to each performance obligation, establishing the pattern of delivery for each distinct performance obligation, and estimating variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. In addition, for revenue under project-based contracts for fixed-price services, revenue is recognized as services are performed using a percentage-of-completion (\u201cPOC\u201d) method based on costs or labor-hours input method. Estimated costs to complete each contract are based on i) future labor and product costs and ii) expected productivity efficiencies. Changes in these estimates can have a material effect on revenue recognized and/or related cost. Finally, the Company recognized Gainshare royalty revenue in the same period in which the usage occurs. The Company accrues the related revenue based on estimates of customers\u2019 underlying sales achievements. These estimates are based on historical data, trends, seasonality, changes in contract rate, knowledge of changes in the industry and changes in the customer\u2019s manufacturing environment learned through discussions with customers and sales personnel. The principal audit considerations for our determination that performing procedures related to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition for customer agreements is a critical audit matter are the significant amount of judgment required by management in this process. Significant judgment is required in determining SSP as the Company rarely licenses software on a standalone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing audit procedures in assessing the allocation of SSPs to performance obligations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining the total estimated contract costs for fixed-price contracts, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating the total estimated contract costs. Significant judgment is also required in recording Gainshare royalty revenue in the same period in which the usage occurs. The Company generally does not receive the acknowledgment reports from customers during a given quarter, so the Company is required to accrue the related revenue based on estimates of customers underlying sales achievement, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in evaluating the reasonableness of these estimates based on historical data, trends, seasonality and other factors. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of internal controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including internal controls related to (1) the identification of distinct performance obligations and data used to establish SSP for licenses, subscriptions, products and services, (2) project estimates to completion for fixed fee arrangements accounted for under POC and (3) estimates of Gainshare royalty revenue accrual and subsequent true-ups. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating management\u2019s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness. In addition, for a sample of customer agreements, we obtained and read contract source documents, including master agreements and other documents that were part of the agreement, tested management\u2019s identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations and variable consideration, assessed the terms in the customer agreements and evaluated the appropriateness of management\u2019s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions, and tested the mathematical accuracy of management\u2019s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates of SSP for projects and services that are not sold separately, where applicable, costs to complete for project-based contracts for fixed-price services and customers\u2019 underlying achievements for royalty revenue. We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.  /s/ BPM LLP  San Jose, CA March 1, 2023   49 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PDF Solutions, Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business PDF Solutions, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cPDF\u201d), provides products and services designed to empower organizations across the semiconductor ecosystem to connect, collect, manage, and analyze data about design, equipment, manufacturing, and test to improve the yield and quality of their products and operational efficiency. The Company\u2019s products, services, and solutions include proprietary software, physical intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) for integrated circuit (\u201cIC\u201d) designs, electrical measurement hardware tools, proven methodologies, and professional services. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these financial statements include revenue recognition, the estimated useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets, assumptions made in analysis of allowance for doubtful accounts, fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation for deferred tax assets, and accounting for lease obligations, stock- based compensation expense, and income tax uncertainties and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates and may result in material effects on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial position. The global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the operations and purchasing decisions of companies worldwide. As of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance relating to COVID-19 that would require updates to the Company\u2019s estimates and judgments or revisions to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with what it considers high credit quality financial institutions. The Company primarily sells its products and services to companies in Asia, Europe and North America within the semiconductor industry. As of December 31, 2022, three customers accounted for 53% of the Company\u2019s gross accounts receivable and two customers accounted for 41% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for 2022. As of December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for 44% of the Company\u2019s gross accounts receivable and two customers accounted for 27% of the Company\u2019s revenues for 2021. See Note 13 for further details. The Company does not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts, which was based on management\u2019s best estimates, could be adjusted in the near term from current estimates depending on actual experience. Such adjustments could be material to the consolidated financial statements. 57 Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less or investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the purchase to be cash equivalents and investments with original maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year to be short-term investments. The Company classifies securities with readily determinable market values as available-for-sale. Short-term investments include available-for-sale securities and are carried at estimated fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses deemed temporary in nature, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary are based on the specific identification method and are included as a component of other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. The Company periodically reviews short-term investments for impairment. In the event a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. When determining if a decline in value is other- than-temporary, the Company takes into consideration the current market conditions, the duration and severity of and the reason for the decline, and the likelihood that it would need to sell the security prior to a recovery of par value. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, short-term investments consisted solely of U.S. Treasury bills. The cost of these securities approximated fair value and there was no material gross realized or unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were also no impairments in the investments\u2019 value in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 14, \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d for further discussion on the Company\u2019s investments. Restricted cash of $3.5 million noted in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 pertains to the amount specifically designated to pay for the Holdback amount related to the Company\u2019s acquisition of Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d). Refer to Note 4, \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d for further discussion about the payment of Holdback Amount in fiscal 2021. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable include amounts that are unbilled at the end of the period that are expected to be billed and collected within a 12-month period. Unbilled accounts receivable are determined on an individual contract basis. Unbilled accounts receivable, included in accounts receivable, totaled $13.5 million and $11.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unbilled accounts receivable that are not expected to be billed and collected during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded in other non-current assets and totaled $0.8 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon the Company\u2019s assessment of the expected collectability of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. Accounts receivable reserves are summarized below (in thousands):   Deductions/  Balance at Charged  Write-offs  Balance at  Beginning Charged to Against of Accounts End of of Period Expense (1) Revenue (1) Receivable Period 2022 ...................... $ 890 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 890 2021 ...................... $ 963 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ (73) $ 890 2020 ...................... $ 213 $ \u2014 $ 800 $ (50) $ 963 (1)Additions to the accounts receivable reserve for doubtful accounts are charged to bad debt expense. Additions to the receivable reserve for billing adjustments are charged against revenue. 58 Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (in years) of the related asset as follows:  Computer equipment ......................................... 3 Software ................................................... 3 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment .............................. 5-10 Laboratory and test equipment ................................. 3-10 Leasehold improvements .....................................  Shorter of estimated useful life or term of lease Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of acquired technology, certain contract rights, customer relationships, patents, trademarks and trade names. These intangible assets may be acquired through business combinations or direct purchases. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from one to ten years. The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets. Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset group is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Goodwill The Company records goodwill when the purchase consideration of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets as of the date of acquisition. The Company has one operating segment and one operating unit. The Company performs a qualitative analysis when testing a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill for impairment. The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or more frequently, if required to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount of excess, limited to the amount of total goodwill. Leases The Company has operating leases for administrative and sales offices, research and development laboratory and clean room. The Company recognizes long-term operating lease rights and commitments as operating lease right-of-use assets (ROU), operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities, non-current, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets, and operating lease liabilities are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease terms include the minimum unconditional term of the lease, and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain at the commencement date that such options will be exercised. The decision to include these options involves consideration of our overall future business plans and other relevant business economic factors that may affect our business. Since the determination of the lease term requires an application of judgment, lease terms that differ in reality from our initial judgment may potentially have a material impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate. In determining the present value of the Company\u2019s expected lease payments, the discount rate is calculated using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate determined based on the information available, which requires additional judgment. 59 Software Development Costs Internally developed software is software developed to meet our internal needs to provide certain services to the customers. The Company\u2019s capitalized software development costs consist of internal compensation related costs and external direct costs incurred during the application development stage and are amortized over their useful lives, generally five to six years. The costs to develop software that is marketed externally have not been capitalized as we believe our current software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, all related software development costs are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expense in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Cost of Revenues Costs of revenues consist primarily of costs incurred to provide and support our services, costs recognized in connection with licensing our software, IT and facilities-related costs and amortization of acquired technology. Service costs include material, personnel-related costs including compensation, employee benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, subcontractor costs, overhead costs, travel, and allocated facilities-related costs. Software license costs consist of costs associated with cloud-delivery related expenses and licensing third-party software used by us in providing services to the Company\u2019s customers in solution engagements or sold in conjunction with the Company\u2019s software products. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs including compensation, employee benefits, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, outside development services, travel, third-party cloud-services related costs, IT and facilities cost allocations to support product development activities. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs including compensation, employee benefits, bonus, commission and stock-based compensation expense for sales, marketing and general and administrative personnel, legal, tax and accounting services, marketing communications expenses, third-party cloud- services related costs, travel, IT and facilities cost allocations. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method, which requires the Company to measure stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The fair value of the Company\u2019s restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) is equal to the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of the grant. These awards are subject to time-based vesting which generally occurs over a period of four years. The fair value of the Company\u2019s stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company\u2019s stock options. The expected life is based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock options granted. The interest rate assumption is based upon observed Treasury yield curve rates appropriate for the expected life of the Company\u2019s stock options. 60 Income Taxes The Company\u2019s provision for income tax comprises its current tax liability and change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws; the effect of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that in management\u2019s judgment is more likely than not to be recoverable against future taxable income. No U.S. taxes are provided on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent such earnings are deemed to be permanently invested. The Company\u2019s income tax calculations are based on application of applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign tax laws. The Company\u2019s tax filings, however, are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities. Accordingly, the Company recognizes tax liabilities based upon its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accrued, the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period (excluding outstanding stock options and shares subject to repurchase). Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the potential effect of dilutive securities which are convertible into common shares (using the treasury stock method), except in cases in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, upon vesting of RSUs, contingently issuable shares for all periods and assumed issuance of shares under the Company\u2019s employee stock purchase plan. No dilutive potential common shares are included in the computation of any diluted per share amount when a loss from continuing operations was reported by the Company. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency for the respective subsidiary. The assets and liabilities are translated at the period-end exchange rate, and statements of comprehensive loss are translated at the average exchange rate during the year. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company operates internationally and is exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company does not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company records these forward contracts at fair value. The counterparty to these foreign currency forward contracts is a financial institution that the Company believes is creditworthy, and therefore, we believe the credit risk of counterparty non-performance is not significant. These foreign currency forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component of interest and other income (expense), net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which are also recorded in interest and other income (expense), net. The duration of these forward contracts is usually three months. Business Combinations The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the business combination. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as 61 goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired customers, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects the Company\u2019s amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including in-process research and development, and goodwill, are not amortized but tested annually for impairment. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for losses related to litigation when a potential loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requirements. See Note 8, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d. Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on internal information, external information, or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU No. 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with a forward-looking expected credit loss model, which will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU No. 2016-13, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses, ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instrument, ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326) Targeted Transition Relief, ASU No. 2016-13, ASU No. 2019-10 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842), and ASU No. 2019-11 Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses. The subsequent ASUs do not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU No. 2016-13. Instead, these amendments are intended to clarify and improve operability of certain topics included within ASU No. 2016-13. Additionally, ASU No. 2019-10 defers the effective date for the adoption of the new standard on credit losses for public filers that are considered small reporting companies (\u201cSRC\u201d) as defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt this standard effective the first quarter of 2023. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, which provides guidance regarding methodologies, documentation, and internal controls related to expected credit losses. The subsequent amendments will have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU No. 2016-13. Topic 326 requires a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of Topic 326 on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosure but does not believe it will have a material effect. Management has reviewed other recently issued accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, and does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.    62 "

            "2. REVENUE": "The Company derives revenue from two sources: Analytics revenue and Integrated Yield Ramp revenue. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , and its related amendments (collectively known as \u201cASC 606\u201d). ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those promised products or services. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following five steps: \u2022  Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer \u2022  Identification of the performance obligations in the contract \u2022  Determination of the transaction price \u2022  Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract \u2022  Recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. "
        },
        {
            "Contracts with multiple performance obligations": "The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of licenses, products and services, some of which are distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d). Analytics Revenue Analytics revenue is derived from the following primary offerings: licenses and services for standalone software (which is primarily Exensio \u00ae and Cimetrix \u00ae products), SaaS (which is primarily Exensio products), and DFI\u2122 systems and CV \u00ae systems (including Characterization services) that do not include performance incentives based on customers\u2019 yield achievement. Revenue from standalone software is recognized depending on whether the license is perpetual or time-based. Perpetual (one-time charge) license software is recognized at the time of the inception of the arrangement when control transfers to the customers, if the software license is considered as a separate performance obligation from the services offered by the Company. Revenue from post-contract support is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis, because we are providing (i) support and (ii) unspecified software updates on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. Revenue from time-based-licensed software is allocated to each performance obligation and is recognized either at a point in time or over time as follows. The license component is recognized at the time when control transfers to customers, with the post-contract support component recognized ratably over the committed term of the contract. For contracts with any combination of licenses, support, and other services, distinct performance obligations are accounted for separately. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using the SSP attributed to each performance obligation. Revenue from SaaS arrangements, which allow for the use of a cloud-based software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without the customer having to take possession of software, is accounted for as a subscription and is recognized as revenue ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the subscription period beginning on the date the service is first made available to customers. For contracts with any combination of SaaS and related services, distinct performance obligations are accounted for separately. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we 63 allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using SSP attributed to each performance obligation. Revenue from DFI systems and CV systems (including Characterization services) that do not include performance incentives based on customers\u2019 yield achievement is recognized primarily as services are performed. Where there are distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their SSPs. For those contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using SSP attributed to each performance obligation. Where there are not discrete performance obligations, historically, revenue is primarily recognized as services are performed using a percentage of completion method based on costs or labor-hours inputs, whichever is the most appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. The estimation of percentage of completion method is complex and subject to many variables that require significant judgement. Please refer to \u201cSignificant Judgments\u201d section of this Note for further discussion. Integrated Yield Ramp Revenue Integrated Yield Ramp revenue is derived from the Company\u2019s fixed-fee engagements that include performance incentives based on customers\u2019 yield achievement (which consists primarily of Gainshare royalties) typically based on customer\u2019s wafer shipments, pertaining to these fixed-price contracts, which royalties are variable. Revenue under these project\u2013based contracts, which are delivered over a specific period of time, typically for a fixed fee component paid on a set schedule, is recognized as services are performed using a percentage of completion method based on costs or labor-inputs, whichever is the most appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. Where there are distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their SSPs and allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation on a relative basis using SSP. Similar to the services provided in connection with DFI systems and CV systems that are contributing to Analytics revenue, due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of percentage of completion method is complex and subject to many variables that require significant judgement. Please refer to \u201cSignificant Judgments\u201d section of this Note for further discussion. The Gainshare royalty contained in IYR contracts is a variable fee related to continued usage of the Company\u2019s intellectual property after the fixed-fee service period ends, based on a customer\u2019s yield achievement. Revenue derived from Gainshare is contingent upon the Company\u2019s customers reaching certain defined production yield levels. Gainshare royalty periods are generally subsequent to the delivery of all contractual services and performance obligations. The Company records Gainshare as a usage-based royalty derived from customers\u2019 usage of intellectual property and records it in the same period in which the usage occurs. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into the timing of the transfer of goods and services and the geographical regions. The Company determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The Company\u2019s performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point-in-time. The following table represents a disaggregation of revenue by timing of revenue:            Year Ended December 31,    2022  2021  2020  Over time ....................................... 69 % 65 % 63 % Point-in-time .................................... 31 % 35 % 37 % Total ........................................... 100 % 100 % 100 %  64 International revenues accounted for approximately 50%, 55% and 58% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 13, \u201cCustomer and Geographic Information\u201d. Significant Judgments Judgments and estimates are required under ASC 606. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under ASC 606 for the Company\u2019s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances. For revenue under project-based contracts for fixed-price implementation services, revenue is recognized as services are performed using a percentage-of-completion method based on costs or labor-hours input method, whichever is the most appropriate measure of the progress towards completion of the contract. Due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of percentage of completion method is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Key factors reviewed by the Company to estimate costs to complete each contract are future labor and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. If circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such revisions are reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch- up basis in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known. The Company\u2019s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer products, licenses software and provide services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. Determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. The Company rarely licenses software on a standalone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not license the software or sell the service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. The Company is required to record Gainshare royalty revenue in the same period in which the usage occurs. Because the Company generally does not receive the acknowledgment reports from its customers during a given quarter within the time frame necessary to adequately review the reports and include the actual amounts in quarterly results for such quarter, the Company accrues the related revenue based on estimates of customers underlying sales achievement. The Company\u2019s estimation process can be based on historical data, trends, seasonality, changes in the contract rate, knowledge of the changes in the industry and changes in the customer\u2019s manufacturing environment learned through discussions with customers and sales personnel. As a result of accruing revenue for the quarter based on such estimates, adjustments will be required in the following quarter to true-up revenue to the actual amounts reported. Contract Balances The Company performs its obligations under a contract with a customer by licensing software or providing services in exchange for consideration from the customer. The timing of the Company\u2019s performance often differs from the timing of the customer\u2019s payment, which results in the recognition of a receivable, a contract asset or a contract liability. The Company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for software or services transferred to a customer as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional, as compared to a contract asset, which is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. The majority of the Company\u2019s contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to fixed-price service contracts when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. The contract assets are generally classified as current and are recorded on a net basis with deferred revenue (i.e. contract liabilities) at the contract level. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, contract assets of $3.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not record any asset impairment charges related to contract assets during fiscal year 2022 and 2021. Deferred revenues and billings in excess of recognized revenues consist substantially of amounts invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and are recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Deferred revenues that will be 65 recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded as current deferred revenues and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current deferred revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, that was included in the deferred revenues and billings in excess of recognized revenues balances at the beginning of each reporting period was $24.9 million, $16.9 million and $10.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was approximately $277.7 million. Given the applicable contract terms with customers, the majority of this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next two years, with the remainder in the following three years. This amount does not include significant contracts to which the customer is not committed, future sales-based or usage-based royalty payments in exchange for a license of intellectual property, and future payments for performance obligations from on-demand arrangements. This amount is subject to change due to future revaluations of variable consideration, terminations, other contract modifications, or currency adjustments. The estimated timing of the recognition of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations is subject to change and is affected by changes to the scope, change in timing of delivery of products and services, or contract modifications. The adjustment to revenue recognized in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods was an increase of $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.4 million and an increase $0.1 million, respectively. These amounts primarily represent changes in estimated percentage-of- completion based contracts and changes in actual versus estimated Gainshare royalty. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer, including direct sales commissions and related fees, when it expects to recover those costs. Amortization expense related to these capitalized costs is recognized over the period associated with the revenue from which the cost was incurred. Total capitalized direct sales commission costs included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Total capitalized direct sales commission costs included in other non-current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Amortization of these assets for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $1.5 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented. Practical Expedients The Company does not adjust transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component when the period between the transfers of the promised good or service to the customer and payment for that good or service by the customer is expected to be one year or less. The Company assessed each of its revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists, and determined its contracts did not include a significant financing component for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 3.

            "4. BUSINESS COMBINATION": "On December 1, 2020 (the \u201cAcquisition Date\u201d), the Company acquired all the stock of Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d). Cimetrix a global provider of equipment connectivity products for smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 that enable factory equipment to communicate to increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve quality. The combination of Cimetrix connectivity products and platforms with the Company\u2019s Exensio analytics platform powered by machine learning, is intended to enable IC, assembly, and electronics manufacturer customers to extract more intelligence from their tools, not just data, to build more reliable chips and systems at lower manufacturing costs. The gross purchase price was approximately $37.5 million ($31.6 million net of cash acquired) for all of the outstanding equity of Cimetrix. The net cash payment for this acquisition which also include the payment of adjusted Holdback Amount, as discussed below, was funded from the available cash of the Company. At the Acquisition Date, the Company held back $3.5 million of the purchase price (the \u201cHoldback Amount\u201d) to satisfy adjustments and claims for indemnity arising out of breaches of certain representations, warranties and covenants, and certain other enumerated items in the merger agreement. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment which reduced the Holdback Amount to $3.1 million. The measurement period adjustment did not have an impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The adjusted Holdback Amount of $3.1 million was paid to the participating equity holders in December 2021. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. This method requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their respective estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recorded from this acquisition represents business benefits the Company anticipates from the acquired workforce and expectation for expanded sales opportunities to foster further business growth. Due to the nature of the transaction, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. 67 The final purchase price allocation, completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulted in adjustments to certain assets and liabilities primarily related to Holdback amount, as discussed above, and a reduction to net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1.3 million. The corresponding offset of measurement period acquisition adjustments to goodwill aggregated $1.7 million.  The following summarizes the final allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition, as of the date of the acquisition, is as follows (in thousands, except amortization period):             Amortization  Amount     Period (Years) Allocation of Purchase Price:    Assets    Fair value of tangible assets (including cash of $5,900) ...........................  $ 8,298  Fair value of intangible assets:    Developed technology .................................................... 12,541 8 In-process R&D ......................................................... 3,635 N/A Customer relationships .................................................... 1,967 10 Noncompetition agreements................................................ 848 3 Tradenames and trademarks ................................................ 808 10 Goodwill ............................................................... 11,830 N/A Total assets acquired ......................................................  $  39,927  Liabilities    Accounts payable and accrued expenses .......................................  $ 1,447  Deferred revenue .......................................................... 375  Operating lease liabilities ................................................... 132  Deferred tax liabilities ...................................................... 439  Total liabilities assumed ...................................................  $ 2,393  "

            "7. LEASES": "In 2022, the Company early terminated an office lease contract. The termination of this lease reduced the Company\u2019s operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The 70 gain from the lease termination of approximately $0.1 million was recorded under selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Strategic Partnership with Advantest See Note 3 for the discussion about the Company\u2019s commitments under the strategic partnership with Advantest. Operating Leases Refer to Note 7, \u201cLeases\u201d, for the discussion about the Company\u2019s lease commitments. 71 Indemnifications The Company generally provides a warranty to its customers that its software will perform substantially in accordance with documented specifications typically for a period of 90 days following delivery of its products. The Company also indemnifies certain customers from third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the use of its products. Historically, costs related to these guarantees have not been significant. The Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on its future results of operations. Purchase obligations The Company has purchase obligations with certain suppliers for the purchase of goods and services entered in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2022, total outstanding purchase obligations were $30.4 million, the majority of which due within the next 24 months. Indemnification of Officers and Directors As permitted by the Delaware general corporation law, the Company has included a provision in its certificate of incorporation to eliminate the personal liability of its officers and directors for monetary damages for breach or alleged breach of their fiduciary duties as officers or directors, other than in cases of fraud or other willful misconduct. In addition, the Bylaws of the Company provide that the Company is required to indemnify its officers and directors even when indemnification would otherwise be discretionary, and the Company is required to advance expenses to its officers and directors as incurred in connection with proceedings against them for which they may be indemnified. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors containing provisions that are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware general corporation law. The indemnification agreements require the Company to indemnify its officers and directors against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as officers and directors other than for liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature, to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified, and to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance if available on reasonable terms. The Company has obtained directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance in amounts comparable to other companies of the Company\u2019s size and in the Company\u2019s industry. Since a maximum obligation of the Company is not explicitly stated in the Company\u2019s Bylaws or in its indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Litigation From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for losses related to litigation when a potential loss is probable, and the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with FASB requirements. As of December 31, 2022, except as disclosed below, the Company was not party to any material legal proceedings for which a loss was probable or an amount was accrued. On May 6, 2020, the Company initiated an arbitration proceeding with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center against SMIC New Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation (\u201cSMIC\u201d) due to SMIC\u2019s failure to pay fees due to PDF under a series of contracts. The Company seeks to recover the unpaid fees, a declaration requiring SMIC to pay fees under the contracts in the future (or a lump sum payment to end the contract), and costs associated with bringing the arbitration proceeding. SMIC denies liability and an arbitration hearing was held in February 2023. The decision is expected within approximately three to six months. "

            "10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS": "On December 31, 2022, the Company had the following stock-based compensation plans: Employee Stock Purchase Plans In July 2001, the Company\u2019s stockholders initially approved the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was subsequently amended and restated in 2010 (as amended, the \u201c2010 Purchase Plan\u201d) to extend the term of the plan through May 17, 2020. Under the 2010 Purchase Plan, eligible employees can contribute up to 10% of their compensation, as defined in the Purchase Plan, towards the purchase of shares of PDF common stock at a price of 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period. The 2010 Purchase Plan provided for twenty-four-month offering periods with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. The 2010 Purchase Plan expired on May 17, 2020. Existing offering periods under the 2010 Plan continued through the applicable expiration date and the final offering period expired on January 31, 2022. On June 15, 2021, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which has a ten-year term (the \u201c2021 Purchase Plan\u201d and, together with the 2010 Purchase Plan, the \u201cEmployee Purchase Plans\u201d). The terms of 2021 Purchase Plan are substantially similar to those of the 2010 Purchase Plan. A twenty-four-month offering period under the 2021 Purchase Plan commenced on August 1, 2021. 73 The Company estimated the fair value of purchase rights granted under the Employee Purchase Plans during the period using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions, resulting in the following weighted average fair values:                 2021 Purchase Plan  2010 Purchase Plan    Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31,  Year Ended December 31,    2022  2021  2020  Expected life (in years) ..................... 1.25  1.25  1.25 Volatility ................................ 48.73 % 48.00 % 34.25 % Risk-free interest rate ...................... 2.75 % 0.11 % 1.43 % Expected dividend ......................... \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 Weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted during the period ............  $ 10.00 $ 6.71 $ 4.83  During the year ended December 31, 2022, a total of 182,083 shares were issued under the 2021 Purchase Plan, at a weighted-average purchase price of $16.15 per share. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, a total of 5,203, 108,623 and 183,078 shares, respectively, were issued under the 2010 Purchase Plan, at a weighted-average purchase price of $13.40 per share, $9.53 per share and $9.12 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2021 Purchase Plan was $1.1 million. This estimated unrecognized cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 year. There was no unrecognized compensation cost related to the 2010 Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 817,917 shares were available for future issuance under the 2021 Purchase Plan. Stock Incentive Plans On November 16, 2011, the Company\u2019s stockholders initially approved the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, which has been amended and restated and approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders a number of times since then (as amended, the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d). Under the 2011 Plan, the Company may award stock options, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSARs\u201d), stock grants or stock units covering shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to employees, directors, non-employee directors and contractors. The aggregate number of shares reserved for awards under the 2011 Plan is 12,800,000 shares, plus up to 3,500,000 shares previously issued under the 2001 Stock Plan adopted by the Company in 2001, which expired in 2011 (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) that are either (i) forfeited or (ii) repurchased by the Company or are shares subject to awards previously issued under the 2001 Plan that expire or that terminate without having been exercised or settled in full on or after November 16, 2011. In case of awards other than options or SARs, the aggregate number of shares reserved under the 2011 Plan will be decreased at a rate of 1.33 shares issued pursuant to such awards. The exercise price for stock options must generally be at prices no less than the fair market value at the date of grant. Stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and become vested and exercisable over a four-year period. As of December 31, 2022, 13.3 million shares of common stock were reserved to cover stock-based awards under the 2011 Plan, of which 3.5 million shares were available for future grant. The number of shares reserved and available under the 2011 Plan includes 0.5 million shares that were subject to awards previously made under the 2001 Plan and were forfeited, expired or repurchased by the Company after the adoption of the 2011 Plan through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding awards that had been granted outside of the 2011 or 2001 Plans (collectively, the \u201cStock Plans\u201d). The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, interest rate and expected dividend. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company\u2019s stock options. The expected life of an award is based on historical experience and on the 74 terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees. The interest rate assumption is based upon observed Treasury yield curve rates appropriate for the expected life of the Company\u2019s stock options.               Year Ended December 31,    2022  2021  2020  Expected life (in years) .......................................  \u2014  \u2014 4.45 Volatility .................................................. \u2014 % \u2014 % 40.90 % Risk-free interest rate ........................................ \u2014 % \u2014 % 0.60 % Expected dividend ........................................... \u2014  \u2014 \u2014 Weighted average fair value per share of options granted during the period ................................................... $ \u2014 $ \u2014  $ 5.75  No stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award\u2019s fair value and is recognized on a straight- line basis over the vesting periods, generally four years. As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expenses related to the Company\u2019s stock plans and employee stock purchase plans were allocated as follows (in thousands):              Year Ended December 31,   2022  2021  2020 Costs of revenues ............................................ $ 2,974 $ 2,563 $ 3,454 Research and development .....................................  9,391  5,515  4,800 Selling, general and administrative ..............................  7,284  4,853  4,209 Stock-based compensation expenses ............................. $ 19,649 $ 12,931 $ 12,463  The stock-based compensation expense in the table above includes immaterial expense or credit adjustments related to cash-settled SARs granted to certain employees. The Company accounted for these awards as liability awards and the amount was included in accrued compensation and related benefits. SARs were fully exercised in the third quarter of 2020. Stock-based compensation capitalized in the capitalized software development costs included in property and equipment, net, was nil, nil and approximately $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 75 Additional information with respect to options under the Plans is as follows:              Outstanding Options            Weighted       Weighted Average       Average  Remaining Aggregate   Number of  Exercise Contractual Intrinsic   Options  Price  Term  Value   (in thousands) per Share (Years) (in thousands) Outstanding, January 1, 2020 ............ 745  $ 10.64   Granted (weighted average fair value of $5.75 per share) ................. 24  $ 16.72   Exercised ..........................

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $2.3 million, $3.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was $0.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to unvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 years. The total fair value of options vested during the year ended December 31, 2022, was $0.1 million. 76 Nonvested shares (restricted stock units) were as follows:            Weighted     Average Grant   Shares Date Fair Value  (in thousands) Per Share Nonvested, January 1, 2020 .............................................. 1,887  $ 12.30 Granted ............................................................ 890  $ 21.31 Vested .............................................................

That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. Restricted stock units do not have rights to dividends prior to vesting. 401(k) Savings Plan The Company sponsors a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d) covering substantially all of its US employees. The Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan with a 401(k) salary deferral arrangement qualified under appropriate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) and applicable state laws.  Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees may make pre-tax salary or after-tax contributions up to 60% of annual compensation, as defined by the 401(k) Plan. In addition, participants who have reached the age of 50 can elect to withhold additional catch-up contributions subject to the Code and the 401(k) Plan limits. Participants may also contribute amounts representing distributions from other qualified plans (rollovers). The Company may make discretionary matching contributions. In fiscal 2022, the Company matches from 50% to 100% of each employee\u2019s contribution up to a maximum of 4% of the employee\u2019s total eligible earnings. The Company\u2019s matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan aggregated $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. No discretionary Company contributions have been made to the Plan through December 31, 2021.  77  "

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state research and experimental and other tax credit (\u201cR&D credits\u201d) carry-forwards of approximately $21.8 million and $22.8 million, respectively. The federal credits began to expire in 2022, while the California credits have no expiration. The extent to which the federal and state credit carry forwards can be used to offset future tax liabilities, respectively, may be limited, depending on the extent of ownership changes within any three-year period as provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the California Conformity Act of 1987. The Company assesses its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a regular basis, and where applicable, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company determined a full valuation allowance was still appropriate for its federal and state net deferred tax assets (DTAs) at December 31, 2022, primarily driven by a cumulative loss incurred over the 12-quarter period ended December 31, 2022 and the likelihood that the Company will not utilize tax attributes before they begin to expire. The valuation allowance was approximately $59.2 million and $51.6 78 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by a net increase in timing differences relating to deferred revenue, accrued bonus and  credits generated in the current year which require a valuation allowance. Management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and may change its conclusion in a future period based on any change in facts (e.g. 12-quarter cumulative profit, significant new revenue, and other relevant factors). If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not to utilize some or all of its US DTAs, it will release some or all of its valuation allowance and our tax provision will decrease in the period in which we make such determination. Net deferred tax assets, after the US valuation allowance, was immaterial as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The components of the net deferred tax assets are comprised of (in thousands):           December 31,   2022  2021 Deferred tax assets    Net operating loss carry forward .......................................... $ 3,861 $ 13,149 Research and development and other credit carry forward ......................  28,046  26,591 Foreign tax credit carry forward ...........................................  11,764  11,010 Capitalized research and experimental expenses ..............................  10,069  \u2014 Accruals deductible in different periods ....................................  7,713  3,362 Leases ................................................................  1,623  1,472 Stock-based compensation ...............................................  1,948  1,442 Total deferred tax assets .....................................................  65,024  57,026 Less: valuation allowance ................................................

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the Company\u2019s income tax provision. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $0.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.8 million, respectively. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized (reversal of) charges for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of ($61,000), ($89,000) and $33,000 respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. The Company\u2019s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2022 was $15.1 million, of which $2.0 million, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $2.6 million, including interest and penalties of $0.7 million, as long-term income taxes payable in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $13.2 million has been recorded within our deferred tax assets, which is subject to a full valuation allowance. The Company does not expect the change in unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months to materially impact its results of operations and financial position. 79 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):        Amount Gross unrecognized tax benefits, January 1, 2020 ............................................ $ 13,615 Increases in tax positions for current year ................................................  1,024 Increases in tax positions for prior years .................................................  71 Lapse in statute of limitations ..........................................................

(622) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, December 31, 2022 ......................................... $ 15,109  The Company does not provide deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as it intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings. The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations currently remains open for the years ended 2019 to present and 2018 to present, respectively. In addition, due to NOL carryback claims, the tax years 2013 through 2015 may be subject to federal examination and all of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that may be utilized in future years may be subject to federal and state examination. The Company is not currently under income tax examinations in the US or in any other of its major foreign subsidiaries\u2019 jurisdictions.

            "12. NET LOSS PER SHARE": "Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period (excluding outstanding stock options and shares subject to repurchase). Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the potential effect of dilutive securities which are convertible into common shares (using the treasury stock method), except in cases in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands except per share amount):              Year Ended December 31,   2022  2021  2020 Numerator:     Net loss ...........................................................  $  (3,429) $  (21,488) $  (40,363) Denominator:     Basic weighted-average shares outstanding ............................     37,309     37,138     34,458 Effect of dilutive options and restricted stock units ...................... \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding ............................     37,309     37,138     34,458     Net loss per share, basic and diluted ...................................  $ (0.09) $ (0.58) $ (1.17)  For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, because the Company was in a loss position, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share as the inclusion of the potential common shares would have been anti- dilutive.

CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The multiple assumptions used to value financial instruments are referred to as inputs, and a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value is established, that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable    82 inputs be used when available. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity\u2019s pricing based upon its own market assumptions. These inputs are ranked according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.    Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 - Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.  The following table represents the Company\u2019s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and the basis for that measurement (in thousands):                 Fair Value Measurements Using     Quoted         Prices in         Active Significant     Markets for Other       Identical Observable Significant  December 31, Assets  Inputs Unobservable Assets  2022 (Level 1)     (Level 2)     Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents      Money market mutual funds ..................  $ 75,738  $ 75,738  $ \u2014  $ \u2014 U.S. Government securities (1) ................ 1,990 1,990 \u2014 \u2014 Short-term investments (available-for-sale debt securities)      U.S. Government securities (1) ................ 19,557 19,557 \u2014 \u2014 Total ........................................  $ 97,285  $ 97,285  $ \u2014  $ \u2014  The following table represents the Company\u2019s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and the basis for that measurement (in thousands):                 Fair Value Measurements Using     Quoted         Prices in         Active Significant     Markets for Other  Significant     Identical Observable  Unobservable  December 31, Assets  Inputs  Inputs Assets  2021 (Level 1)      (Level 2) (Level 3) Cash equivalents      Money market mutual funds ..................  $ 12,474  $ 12,474  $ \u2014  $ \u2014 Short-term investments (available-for-sale debt securities)     U.S. Government securities (1) ................ 112,542 112,542 \u2014 \u2014 Total ........................................  $ 125,016  $  125,016  $ \u2014  $ \u2014  (1)  The carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investments in U.S. Government securities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities, and there have been no events or changes in circumstances that would have had a significant effect on the fair value of these securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 83 From time to time, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily on third-party accounts payables and intercompany balances. The primary objective of the Company\u2019s hedging program is to reduce volatility of earnings related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The counterparty to these foreign currency forward contracts is a financial institution that the Company believes is creditworthy, and therefore, the Company believes the credit risk of counterparty nonperformance is not significant. These foreign currency forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other expense (income), net, and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other expense (income), net in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. There was no realized gain or loss from foreign currency forward contracts during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a realized loss of $0.2 million on the contracts, which is recorded in interest and other expense (income), net in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no outstanding forward contracts. "
